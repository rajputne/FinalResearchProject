lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and remedies, each grantor hereby grants to the collateral agent (until the termination of this agreement and subject to section7.14) an irrevocable nonexclusive license (exercisable without payment of royalty or other compensation to the grantors), subject in all respects to any licenses to use, license or sublicense any of the collateral consisting of know how, patents, copyrights and trademarks, now owned or hereafter acquired by such grantor, and wherever the same may be located, and including in such license access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer software and programs used for the compilation or printout thereof. the use of such license by the collateral agent may be exercised, at the option of the collateral agent, only upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default; provided, however, that any license or sublicense entered into by the collateral agent with a third party in accordance with this section4.04 shall be binding upon each grantor notwithstanding any subsequent cure of an event of default, except to the extent that such license or sublicense would invalidate or render unenforceable any such grantors intellectual property.  -24- section "},{"sectionNumber":"4.05. securities act, etc.","sectionContent":" in view of the position of the grantors in relation to the pledged collateral, or because of other current or future circumstances, a question may arise under the u.s. securities act of 1933, as now or hereafter in effect, or any similar statute hereafter enacted analogous in purpose or effect (such act and any such similar statute as from time to time in effect being called the federal securities laws) with respect to any disposition of the pledged collateral permitted hereunder. each grantor understands that compliance with the federal securities laws might very strictly limit the course of conduct of the collateral agent if the collateral agent were to attempt to dispose of all or any part of the pledged collateral, and might also limit the extent to which or the manner in which any subsequent transferee of any pledged collateral could dispose of the same. similarly, there may be other legal restrictions or limitations affecting the collateral agent in any attempt to dispose of all or part of the pledged collateral under applicable blue sky or other state securities laws or similar laws analogous in purpose or effect. each grantor recognizes that to the extent such restrictions and limitations apply to any proposed sale of pledged collateral, the collateral agent may, with respect to any sale of such pledged collateral, limit the purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire such pledged collateral for their own account, for investment, and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. each grantor acknowledges and agrees that to the extent such restrictions and limitations apply to any proposed sale of pledged collateral, the collateral agent, in its sole and absolute discretion (a)may proceed to make such a sale whether or not a registration statement for the purpose of registering such pledged collateral or part thereof shall have been filed under the federal securities laws and (b)may approach and negotiate with a limited number of potential purchasers (including a single potential purchaser) to effect such sale. each grantor acknowledges and agrees that any such sale might result in prices and other terms less favorable to the seller than if such sale were a public sale without such restrictions. in the event of any such sale, the collateral agent shall incur no responsibility or liability for selling all or any part of the pledged collateral at a price that the collateral agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, may in good faith deem reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially higher price might have been realized if the sale were deferred until after registration as aforesaid or if more than a limited number of purchasers (or a single purchaser) were approached. the provisions of this section4.05 will apply notwithstanding the existence of a public or private market upon which the quotations or sales prices may exceed substantially the price at which the collateral agent sells. article "},{"sectionNumber":"v indemnity, subrogation and subordination","sectionContent":" section "},{"sectionNumber":"5.01. indemnity and

obligation owed to any loan secured party, and such other guarantor (the claiming guarantor) shall not have been fully indemnified by the borrower as provided in section5.01, the contributing guarantor shall indemnify the claiming guarantor in an  -25- amount equal to (i)the amount of such payment or (ii)the greater of the book value or the fair market value of such assets, as the case may be, in each case multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the net worth of the contributing guarantor on the date hereof and the denominator shall be the aggregate net worth of all the guarantors on the date hereof (or, in the case of any guarantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to section7.16, the date of the supplement hereto executed and delivered by such guarantor). any contributing guarantor making any payment to a claiming guarantor pursuant to this section5.02 shall be subrogated to the rights of such claiming guarantor under section5.01 to the extent of such payment. section "},{"sectionNumber":"5.03. subordination","sectionContent":". notwithstanding any provision of this agreement to the contrary, all rights of the guarantors under sections 5.01 and 5.02 and all other rights of indemnity, contribution or subrogation under applicable law or otherwise shall be fully subordinated to the loan obligations until the termination date; provided, that if any amount shall be paid to such guarantors on account of such subrogation rights at any time prior to the termination date, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the loan secured parties and shall promptly be paid to the collateral agent to be credited and applied against the loan obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with section2.17 of the credit agreement. no failure on the part of the borrower or any guarantor to make the payments required by sections 5.01 and 5.02 (or any other payments required under applicable law or otherwise) shall in

(c) whenever any payment hereunder or under the notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a business day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding business day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or  37 undrawn fee, as the case may be; provided, however, that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of eurocurrency rate advances or libo rate advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding business day. (d) unless the agent shall have received notice from the parent borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the lenders hereunder that the applicable borrower will not make such payment in full, the agent may assume that such borrower has made such payment in full to the agent on such date and the agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such lender. if and to the extent such borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the agent, each lender shall repay to the agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such lender until the date such lender repays such amount to the agent, at (i)in the case of amounts due in dollars, the greater of (a)the federal funds rate and (b)a rate determined by the agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii)in the case of amounts due in euros, the rate per annum determined by the agent to represent its cost of overnight or short-term funds in euros. (e) if any lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to sections 2.02(d), 2.05(b) or (c), 2.06(d), (e)or (j), 7.05 or 9.04(e), then the agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, until the agent reasonably determines that such lender is not a defaulting lender, (i)apply any amounts thereafter received by the agent for the account of such lender for the benefit of the agent, any swing line lender or the issuing lender to satisfy such lenders obligations to it under such section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii)hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such lender under any such section, in the case of each of clauses (i)and (ii)above, in any order as determined by the agent in its discretion. section 2.17.taxes. (a) any and all payments by any borrower hereunder or under the notes shall be made, in accordance with section2.16, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each lender and the agent, taxes imposed on its overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income taxes, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such lender or the agent (as the case may be) is organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each lender, taxes imposed on its overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income taxes, by the jurisdiction of such lenders applicable lending office or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities in respect of payments hereunder or under the notes being hereinafter referred to as taxes). if any borrower shall be required by law to deduct any taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any note to any lender or the agent, (i)the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this section2.17) such lender or the agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii)the applicable borrower shall make such deductions and (iii)the applicable borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law. (b) in addition, each borrower shall pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made by it hereunder or under the notes or from its execution, delivery or registration of, performing under, or otherwise with respect to, this agreement or the notes (hereinafter referred to as other taxes).  38 (c) each borrower shall indemnify each lender and the agent for and hold it harmless against the full amount of taxes or other taxes (including, without limitation, taxes of any kind imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this section2.17) imposed on or paid by such lender or the agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. this indemnification shall be made within 30 days (or, in the case of any such indemnification from a foreign subsidiary borrower, 60 days) from the date such lender or the agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor. (d) within 30 days after the date of any payment of taxes, the parent borrower shall furnish to the agent, at its address referred to in section9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment. in the case of any payment hereunder or under the notes by or on behalf of the parent borrower through an account or branch outside the united states or by or on behalf of the parent borrower by a payor that is not a united states person, if the parent borrower determines that no taxes are payable in respect thereof, the parent borrower shall furnish, or shall cause such payor to furnish, to the agent, at such address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to the agent stating that such payment is exempt from taxes. for purposes of this subsection (d)and subsection (e), the terms united states and united states person shall have the meanings specified in section7701 of the internal revenue code. (e) each lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the united states, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this agreement in the case of each initial lender and on the date of the assumption agreement or the assignment and acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a lender in the case of each other lender, and from time to time thereafter as requested in writing by the parent borrower (but only so long as such lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the agent and the parent borrower with two original u.s. internal revenue service forms w-8ben or w-8eci, as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the u.s. internal revenue service, certifying that such lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of united states withholding tax on payments pursuant to this agreement or the notes. if the form provided by a lender at the time such lender first becomes a party to this agreement indicates a united states interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from taxes unless and until such lender provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from taxes for periods governed by such form; provided, however, that, if at the date of the assignment and acceptance pursuant to which a lender assignee becomes a party to this agreement, the lender assignor was entitled to payments under subsection (a)in respect of united states withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in taxes) united states withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the lender assignee on such date. if any form or document referred to in this subsection (e)requires the disclosure of information, other than information necessary to compute the tax payable and information required on the date hereof by u.s. internal revenue service form w-8ben or w-8eci, that the lender reasonably considers to be confidential, the lender shall give notice thereof to the parent borrower and shall not be obligated to include in such form or document such confidential information. (f) each lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of a non-united states withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which an foreign subsidiary borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this agreement and the notes shall deliver to the applicable foreign subsidiary borrower, at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the relevant foreign subsidiary borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate, provided that such lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver such documentation and in such lenders judgment such completing, execution or submission would not materially prejudice the legal position of such lender.  39 (g) for any period with respect to which a lender has failed to comply with the requirements of section2.17(e) or (f)(other than if such failure is due to a change in law occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally was required to be provided, or if such form otherwise is not required under subsection (e)or (f)above), such lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under section2.17(a) or (c)with respect to taxes imposed by the united states by reason of such failure; provided, however, that should a lender become subject to taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the borrowers shall take such steps as the lender shall reasonably request to assist the lender to recover such taxes. (h) any lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this section2.17 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its eurocurrency lending office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such lender. section 2.18.sharing of payments, etc. if any lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) owing to it on account of the revolving credit advances, swing line advances or the letters of credit (other than pursuant to section2.14, 2.17 or 9.04(c) or as otherwise provided herein) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of such extensions of credit obtained by all the lenders, such lender shall forthwith purchase from the other lenders such participations in such extensions of credit owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing lender, such purchase from each lender shall be rescinded and such lender shall repay to the purchasing lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such lenders ratable share (according to the proportion of (i)the amount of such lenders required repayment to (ii)the total amount so recovered from the purchasing lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. each borrower agrees that any lender so purchasing a participation from another lender pursuant to this section2.18 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such lender were the direct creditor of such borrower in the amount of such participation. section 2.19.use of proceeds. the proceeds of the advances, and letters of credit, shall be available (and each borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds and letters of credit) solely for general corporate purposes of the parent borrower and its subsidiaries. section 2.20.increase in aggregate commitments. (a) the parent borrower may, at any time but in any event not more than once in any calendar year prior to the termination date, by notice to the agent, request that the aggregate amount of the commitments be increased by an amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple thereof (each a commitment increase) to be effective as of a date that is at least 90 days prior to the scheduled termination date then in effect (the increase date) as specified in the related notice to the agent; provided, however that (i)in no event shall the aggregate amount of the commitments at any time exceed $2,500,000,000 and (ii)on the date of any request by the parent borrower for a commitment increase and on the related increase date the applicable conditions set forth in article iii shall be satisfied.  40 (b) the agent shall promptly notify such eligible assignees as the parent borrower may identify of a request by the parent borrower for a commitment increase, which notice shall include (i)the proposed amount of such requested commitment increase, (ii)the proposed increase date and (iii)the date by which lenders and other eligible assignees wishing to participate in the commitment increase must commit thereto (the commitment date). each lender that is willing to participate in such requested commitment increase (each an increasing lender) (it being understood that no lender shall have any obligation to participate in any increase described in this paragraph unless it agrees to do so in its sole discretion) and each other eligible assignee that agrees to participate in such requested commitment increase (each such eligible assignee, an assuming increasing lender) shall give written notice to the agent on or prior to the commitment date of the amount by which it is willing to participate in such commitment increase (each such amount, the designated increase). if the lenders and assuming increasing lenders notify the agent that they are willing to participate in the requested commitment increase by an aggregate amount that exceeds the amount of the requested commitment increase, the requested commitment increase shall be allocated among the lenders and such assuming increasing lenders in such amounts as are agreed between the parent borrower and the agent (so long as any allocation is not in excess of the designated increase of such increasing lender or assuming increasing lender); provided, however, that the commitment of each such assuming increasing lender shall be in an amount of $5,000,000 or more. (c) on each increase date, each assuming increasing lender shall become a lender party to this agreement as of such increase date and the commitment of each increasing lender for such requested commitment increase shall be so increased by such amount (or by the amount allocated to such lender pursuant to the last sentence of section2.20(b)) as of such increase date; provided, however, that the agent shall have received on or before such increase date the following, each dated such date: (i) (a) certified copies of resolutions of the board of directors of each borrower or a committee of each such board approving the commitment increase and the corresponding modifications to this agreement and (b)an opinion of counsel for the borrowers (which may be from in-house counsel), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the agent; (ii) an assumption agreement from each assuming increasing lender, if any, in substantially the form of exhibit d hereto (each an assumption agreement), duly executed by such eligible assignee, the agent, the issuing lenders and the parent borrower, as applicable; (iii) confirmation from each increasing lender of the increase in the amount of its commitment in a writing satisfactory to the parent borrower and the agent; and (iv) any other documents or instruments reasonably requested by the agent in connection with the commitment increase. (d) on each increase date, upon fulfillment of the conditions set forth in the immediately preceding sentence of this section2.20(c), the agent shall notify the lenders (including, without limitation, each assuming increasing lender) and the parent borrower, on or before 1:00 p.m. (new york city time), by fax, of the occurrence of the commitment increase to be effected on such increase date and shall record in the register the relevant information with respect to each increasing lender and each assuming increasing lender on such date. if any base rate advances are outstanding on the date of any increase date, the agent shall give appropriate notice to the increasing lenders and the assuming increasing lenders to fund their respective pro rata shares of such outstanding advances, and shall reallocate such advances among the lenders so that, after giving effect to such reallocation, each lender shall participate in each outstanding base rate borrowing ratably according to their respective commitments. if any eurocurrency rate advances are outstanding on the date of any increase date, the  41 agent shall, on the last day of the applicable interest periods, give appropriate notice to the increasing lenders and the assuming increasing lenders to fund their respective pro rata shares of such outstanding advances, and shall reallocate such advances among the lenders so that, after giving effect to such reallocation, each lender shall participate in such outstanding eurocurrency rate borrowing ratably according to their respective commitments. if any letters of credit or swing line advances are outstanding on any increase date, participations in such extensions of credit shall be deemed to be reallocated on such date according to the respective commitments of the lenders after giving effect to such increase. (e) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement, each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that, on each increase date, this agreement may be amended to the extent (but only to the extent (it being understood that the terms of any commitment increase shall be the same as the terms for the existing commitments)) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the commitment increase evidenced thereby. any such deemed amendment may be effected in writing by the agent with the parent borrowers consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and furnished to the other parties hereto. section 2.21.extension of termination date (a) request procedure. (i) borrower requests. the parent borrower, by written notice to the agent, may, (a)not more than two times after the first amendment effective date and (b)not less than twelve months after the prior extension date, if any, request an extension of the termination date in effect at such time by one year from its then scheduled expiration (the date of any such request, the extension request date); provided that such request is made at least 30 days prior to the applicable termination date. (ii) agent notification. the agent shall promptly notify each lender of such request, and, within 10 business days of the extension request date, each lender shall, in its sole discretion, notify the parent borrower and the agent in writing as to whether such lender will consent to such extension by delivering a notice of extension of termination date (with each lender consenting being a consenting lender and each lender not consenting being a non-consenting lender). if any lender shall fail to notify the agent and the parent borrower in writing of its consent to any such request for extension of the termination date prior to the end of such 10 business day period, such lender shall be deemed to be a non-consenting lender with respect to such request (it being understood that such lender may subsequently deliver a notice of extension of termination date, subject to the consent of the agent and parent borrower, or become an assuming extending lender pursuant to section2.21(c)). the agent shall notify the parent borrower in writing not later than 15 business days after the extension request date of the decision of the lenders regarding the parent borrowers request for an extension of the termination date. it is understood and agreed that no lender shall have any obligation whatsoever to agree to any request made by the parent borrower for any requested extension of the termination date. (b) conditions for extensions. the termination date in effect at such time shall, effective on any date as the parent borrower and agent may agree which occurs (x)on or prior to the then existing termination date and (y)within 60 days of the extension request date (such effective date, the extension date), be extended one year so long as (i)on the applicable extension date, the applicable conditions set forth in article iii are satisfied and (ii)not later than one business day prior to the applicable extension date, lenders having more than 50% of the commitments (after giving effect to any  42 assignments and assumptions pursuant to subsection (c)of this section2.21) shall have consented in writing to a requested extension (whether by execution or delivery of a notice of extension of termination date, an assumption agreement, an assignment and acceptance or other writing acceptable to the agent). the applicable termination date then in effect shall be extended for the additional one-year period as to the consenting lenders and assuming extended lenders in the applicable amount only and shall not be extended as to any non-consenting lender or consenting lender with respect to any amount of its commitment not extended. (c) assignment and assumption of commitments. if fewer than all of the lenders consent to any such request pursuant to subsection (a)of this section2.21, the agent shall promptly so notify the consenting lenders, and, at least 10 days prior to the applicable extension date (or such later date as the parent borrower and agent may agree), each consenting lender may, in its sole discretion, give written notice to the agent of the amount of the non-consenting lenders commitments and consenting lenders commitments which are not being extended for which it is willing to accept an assignment (such amount for each consenting lender, the designated amount). if the consenting lenders notify the agent in writing that they are willing to accept assignments of commitments such that, after giving effect to any assignments and assumptions pursuant to this section2.21(c), lenders having more than 50% of the commitments seek to extend the termination date, such commitments shall be allocated among the consenting lenders willing to accept such assignments in such amounts as are agreed between the parent borrower and the agent (so long as any allocation is not excess of the designated amount of such consenting lender) and the appropriate parties shall be deemed to have executed an assignment and acceptance giving effect to such allocations on the extension date. if, after giving effect to the assignments of commitments described directly above, there remain any commitments of non-consenting lenders or consenting lenders commitments which are not being extended, the parent borrower may arrange for one or more eligible assignees that agree to an extension of the termination date (each, an assuming extending lender) to assume (via an assignment or assumption), any non-consenting lenders commitment or consenting lenders commitments which are not being extended and all of the obligations of such non-consenting lender (or, with respect to such assigned or assumed commitments, of such consenting lender) under this agreement thereafter arising. any assignment or assumption by an assuming extending lender shall be without recourse to or warranty by, or expense to, such non-consenting lender (or, with respect to commitments of it which are being assigned or assumed, such consenting lender); provided, however, that the amount of the commitment of any such assuming extending lender as a result of such assumption shall in no event be less than $10,000,000 unless the amount of the commitment of such non-consenting lender or commitment of such consenting lender not being extended is less than $10,000,000, in which case such assuming extending lender shall assume all of such lesser amount; and provided further that: (i) any such assuming extending lender shall have, with respect to commitments that are the subject of an assignment or assumption, paid to such non-consenting lender or consenting lender, as the case may be, (a)the aggregate principal amount of, and any interest accrued and unpaid to the effective date of the assignment or assumption on, the outstanding advances, if any, of such non-consenting lender or consenting lender plus (b)any accrued but unpaid undrawn fees owing to such non-consenting lender or such consenting lender as of the effective date of such assignment or assumption; (ii) all additional costs, reimbursements, expense reimbursements and indemnities payable to such non-consenting lender or consenting lender, and all other accrued and unpaid amounts owing to such non-consenting lender hereunder, as of the effective date of such assignment shall have been paid to such non-consenting lender or consenting lender; and  43 (iii) with respect to any such assuming extending lender, the applicable processing and recordation fee required under section9.07(a) for such assignment or assumption shall have been paid by the assuming extending lender; provided further that such non-consenting lenders or consenting lenders rights under sections 2.14, 2.17 and 9.04, and its obligations under sections 2.06(j), 7.05 and 9.04(e), shall survive such assignment or assumption as to matters occurring prior to the date of such assignment or assumption. at least three business days prior to any extension date (or such shorter period as the parent borrower and agent may agree), (a)each assuming extending lender, if any, shall have delivered to the parent borrower and the agent an assumption agreement or an assignment and acceptance duly executed by such assuming extending lender, such non-consenting lender or consenting lender, as the case may be, the parent borrower and the agent and (b)each non-consenting lender being replaced pursuant to this section2.21(c) shall have delivered to the agent any note or notes held by such non-consenting lender, if requested by the parent borrower and agent. subject to (x)the payment or prepayment of all amounts referred to in clauses (i), (ii)and (iii)of the immediately preceding sentence, (y)the execution of an assumption agreement or an assignment and acceptance and (z)the conditions set forth in section2.21(b) being satisfied on the applicable extension date, each assuming extending lender, as of such extension date, will be a lender for all purposes of this agreement, without any further acknowledgment by or the consent of the other lenders, and, except as otherwise provided above, the obligations of each such non-consenting lender (or, with respect to commitments of it which are being assigned or assumed, such consenting lender) shall, by the provisions hereof, be released and discharged. (d) reserved. (e) actions undertaken upon extension. in the event of the occurrence of an extension date, (i) to the extent that the termination date is not extended as to any lender pursuant to this section2.21 and the commitment of such lender is not assigned or assumed in accordance with subsection (c)of this section2.21 on or prior to the applicable extension date, the commitment of such non-consenting lender or consenting lender not being extended shall automatically terminate in whole on such unextended termination date without any further notice or other action by the parent borrower, such lender or any other person; provided that such non-consenting lenders rights under sections 2.14, 2.17 and 9.04, and its obligations under sections 2.06(j), 7.05 and 9.04(e), shall survive the termination date for such lender as to matters occurring prior to such date; and (ii) all references in this agreement, and in the notes, if any, to the termination date shall, with respect to each consenting lender and each assuming extending lender for such extension date, refer to the termination date as so extended. promptly following each extension date, the agent shall notify the lenders (including, without limitation, each assuming extending lender) of the extension of the scheduled termination date in effect immediately prior thereto and shall thereupon record in the register the relevant information with respect to each such consenting lender and each such assuming extending lender. section 2.22. evidence of debt. (a) each lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each borrower to such lender resulting from each advance owing to such lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such lender from time to time hereunder in respect of advances. each borrower agrees that upon notice by any lender (with a copy of such notice to the agent) to the effect that a note is required or appropriate in order for such lender to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the advances to such borrower owing to, or to be made by, such lender, such borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such lender a note payable to the order of such lender in a principal amount up to the commitment of such lender.  44 (b) the register maintained by the agent pursuant to section9.07(d) shall include a control account, and a subsidiary account for each lender, in which accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i)the date and amount of each borrowing made hereunder, the type of advances comprising such borrowing, the name of the relevant borrower and, if appropriate, the interest period applicable thereto, (ii)the terms of each assumption agreement and each assignment and acceptance delivered to and accepted by it, (iii)the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each borrower to each lender hereunder and (iv)the amount of any sum received by the agent from each borrower hereunder and each lenders share thereof. (c) entries made in good faith by the agent in the register pursuant to subsection (b)above, and by each lender in its account or accounts pursuant to subsection (a)above, shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each borrower to, in the case of the register, each lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such lender, under this agreement, absent manifest error; provided, however, that the failure of the agent or such lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of any borrower under this agreement. section 2.23.foreign subsidiary borrowers. (a) subject to the consent of the agent, the parent borrower may designate any foreign subsidiary of the parent borrower as a foreign subsidiary borrower by delivery to the agent of a borrowing subsidiary agreement executed by such subsidiary, the parent borrower and the agent and upon such delivery such subsidiary shall for all purposes of this agreement be a foreign subsidiary borrower and a party to this agreement until the parent borrower shall have executed and delivered to the agent a borrowing subsidiary termination with respect to such subsidiary, whereupon such subsidiary shall cease to be a foreign subsidiary borrower. notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no such borrowing subsidiary termination will become effective as to any foreign subsidiary borrower at a time when any foreign borrower obligations of such foreign subsidiary borrower shall be outstanding hereunder or any letters of credit issued for the account of such foreign subsidiary borrower shall be outstanding (which shall not have been cash collateralized in a manner satisfactory to the agent), provided that such borrowing subsidiary termination shall be effective to terminate such foreign subsidiary borrowers right to make further borrowings hereunder. (b) the agent shall promptly notify the lenders of any foreign subsidiary borrower added pursuant to section2.23(a). section 2.24.foreign currency exchange rate. (a) no later than 1:00 p.m. (new york city time) on each calculation date, the agent shall determine the spot exchange rate as of such calculation date with respect to euros, provided that, upon receipt of a notice of revolving credit borrowing pursuant to section2.02(a), the agent shall determine the spot exchange rate with respect to euros on the related calculation date (it being acknowledged and agreed that the agent shall use such spot exchange rate for the purposes of determining compliance with section2.01 with respect to such notice). the spot exchange rate so determined shall become effective on the relevant calculation date (a reset date), shall remain effective until the next succeeding reset date and shall for all purposes of this agreement (other than section9.14 and any other provision expressly requiring the use of a current spot exchange rate) be the spot exchange rate employed in converting any amounts between dollars and euros.  45 (b) no later than 5:00 p.m. (new york city time) on each reset date, the agent shall determine the aggregate amount of the dollar equivalents of the principal amounts of euro advances then outstanding (after giving effect to any euro advances to be made or repaid on such date). (c) the agent shall promptly notify the parent borrower of each determination of a spot exchange rate hereunder. section 2.25.replacement of lenders. the parent borrower shall be permitted to replace any lender that (x)does not consent to any proposed amendment, supplement, modification, consent or waiver of any provision of this agreement or any note that requires the consent of each of the lenders or each of the lenders affected thereby (so long as the consent of the required lenders has been obtained) or (y)becomes a defaulting lender; provided that (a)such replacement does not conflict with any applicable law, rule, regulation, or order, (b)no event of default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, (c)the replacement financial institution shall purchase, at par, all advances and other amounts owing to such replaced lender on or prior to the date of replacement, (d)each borrower shall be liable to such replaced lender under section9.04(c) if any eurocurrency rate advance made to it and owing to such replaced lender shall be purchased other than on the last day of the interest period relating thereto, (e)the replacement financial institution shall be reasonably satisfactory to the agent, (f)the replaced lender shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of section9.07 (provided that the parent borrower shall be obligated to pay the registration and processing fee referred to therein), and (g)any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that any borrower, any agent or any other lender shall have against the replaced lender. section 2.26.defaulting lenders. notwithstanding any provision of this agreement to the contrary, if any lender becomes a defaulting lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such lender is a defaulting lender: (a) fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the commitment of such defaulting lender pursuant to section2.07(a);
