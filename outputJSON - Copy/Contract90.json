the case of a sale at a brokers board or on a securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on which the collateral, or portion thereof, will

court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver.  -23- until the termination date, each grantor irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints the

which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer software and programs used for the compilation or printout thereof. the use of such license by the collateral agent may be exercised, at the option of the collateral agent, only upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default; provided, however, that any license or sublicense entered into by the collateral agent with a third party in accordance with this section4.04 shall be binding upon each grantor notwithstanding any subsequent cure of an event of default, except to the extent that such license or sublicense would invalidate or render unenforceable any such grantors intellectual property.  -24- section "},{"sectionNumber":"4.05. securities act, etc.","sectionContent":" in view of the position of the grantors in relation to the pledged collateral, or because of other current or future circumstances, a question may arise under the u.s. securities act of 1933, as now or hereafter in effect, or any similar statute hereafter enacted analogous in purpose or effect (such act and any such similar statute as from time to time in effect being called the federal securities laws) with respect to any disposition of the pledged collateral permitted hereunder. each grantor understands that compliance with the federal securities laws might very strictly limit the course of conduct of the collateral agent if the collateral agent were to attempt to dispose of all or any part of the pledged collateral, and might also limit the extent to which or the manner in which any subsequent transferee of any pledged collateral could dispose of the same. similarly, there may be other legal restrictions or limitations affecting the collateral agent in any attempt to dispose of all or part of the pledged collateral under applicable blue sky or other state securities laws or similar laws analogous in purpose or effect. each grantor recognizes that to the extent such restrictions and limitations apply to any proposed sale of pledged collateral, the collateral agent may, with respect to any sale of such pledged collateral, limit the purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire such pledged collateral for their own account, for investment, and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. each grantor acknowledges and agrees that to the extent such restrictions and limitations apply to any proposed sale of pledged collateral, the collateral agent, in its sole and absolute discretion (a)may proceed to make such a sale whether or not a registration statement for the purpose of registering such pledged collateral or part thereof shall have been filed under the federal securities laws and (b)may approach and negotiate with a limited number of potential purchasers (including a single potential purchaser) to effect such sale. each grantor acknowledges and agrees that any such sale might result in prices and other terms less favorable to the seller than if such sale were a public sale without such restrictions. in the event of any such sale, the collateral agent shall incur no responsibility or liability for selling all or any part of the pledged collateral at a price that the collateral agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, may in good faith deem reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially higher price might have been realized if the sale were deferred until after registration as aforesaid or if more than a limited number of purchasers (or a single purchaser) were approached. the provisions of this section4.05 will apply notwithstanding the existence of a public or private market upon which the quotations or sales prices may exceed substantially the price at which the collateral agent sells. article "},{"sectionNumber":"v indemnity, subrogation and subordination","sectionContent":" section "},{"sectionNumber":"5.01. indemnity and

(c) each notice of revolving credit borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the relevant borrower. in the case of any revolving credit borrowing that the related notice of revolving credit borrowing specifies is to be comprised of eurocurrency rate advances, the relevant borrower shall indemnify each lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such lender as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in such notice of revolving credit borrowing for such  21 revolving credit borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in article iii, including, without limitation, any loss (excluding loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such lender to fund the revolving credit advance to be made by such lender as part of such revolving credit borrowing when such revolving credit advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date. (d) unless the agent shall have received notice from a lender prior to the date (or, in the case of base rate advances, prior to 1:00 p.m. (new york city time) on the date) of any revolving credit borrowing that such lender will not make available to the agent such lenders ratable portion of such revolving credit borrowing, the agent may assume that such lender has made such portion available to the agent on the date of such revolving credit borrowing in accordance with subsection (a)of this section2.02 and the agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the borrower that requested such borrowing on such date a corresponding amount in the applicable currency. if and to the extent that such lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the agent, such lender and each borrower severally agree to repay to the agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in the applicable currency together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to such borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the agent, at (i)in the case of such borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to revolving credit advances comprising such revolving credit borrowing and (ii)in the case of such lender, (a)with respect to dollar advances, the greater of (x)the federal funds rate and (y)a rate determined by the agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (b)with respect to euro advances, the rate per annum determined by the agent to represent its cost of overnight or short-term funds in euros. if such lender shall repay to the agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such lenders revolving credit advance as part of such borrowing for purposes of this agreement. (e) the failure of any lender to make the revolving credit advance to be made by it as part of any revolving credit borrowing shall not relieve any other lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its revolving credit advance on the date of such borrowing, but no lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other lender to make the revolving credit advance to be made by such other lender on the date of any revolving credit borrowing. section 2.03.the competitive bid advances.

(d) within 30 days after the date of any payment of taxes, the parent borrower shall furnish to the agent, at its address referred to in section9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment. in the case of any payment hereunder or under the notes by or on behalf of the parent borrower through an account or branch outside the united states or by or on behalf of the parent borrower by a payor that is not a united states person, if the parent borrower determines that no taxes are payable in respect thereof, the parent borrower shall furnish, or shall cause such payor to furnish, to the agent, at such address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to the agent stating that such payment is exempt from taxes. for purposes of this subsection (d)and subsection (e), the terms united states and united states person shall have the meanings specified in section7701 of the internal revenue code. (e) each lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the united states, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this agreement in the case of each initial lender and on the date of the assumption agreement or the assignment and acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a lender in the case of each other lender, and from time to time thereafter as requested in writing by the parent borrower (but only so long as such lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the agent and the parent borrower with two original u.s. internal revenue service forms w-8ben or w-8eci, as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the u.s. internal revenue service, certifying that such lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of united states withholding tax on payments pursuant to this agreement or the notes. if the form provided by a lender at the time such lender first becomes a party to this agreement indicates a united states interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from taxes unless and until such lender provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from taxes for periods governed by such form; provided, however, that, if at the date of the assignment and acceptance pursuant to which a lender assignee becomes a party to this agreement, the lender assignor was entitled to payments under subsection (a)in respect of united states withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in taxes) united states withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the lender assignee on such date. if any form or document referred to in this subsection (e)requires the disclosure of information, other than information necessary to compute the tax payable and information required on the date hereof by u.s. internal revenue service form w-8ben or w-8eci, that the lender reasonably considers to be confidential, the lender shall give notice thereof to the parent borrower and shall not be obligated to include in such form or document such confidential information. (f) each lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of a non-united states withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which an foreign subsidiary borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this agreement and the notes shall deliver to the applicable foreign subsidiary borrower, at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the relevant foreign subsidiary borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate, provided that such lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver such documentation and in such lenders judgment such completing, execution or submission would not materially prejudice the legal position of such lender.  39 (g) for any period with respect to which a lender has failed to comply with the requirements of section2.17(e) or (f)(other than if such failure is due to a change in law occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally was required to be provided, or if such form otherwise is not required under subsection (e)or (f)above), such lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under section2.17(a) or (c)with respect to taxes imposed by the united states by reason of such failure; provided, however, that should a lender become subject to taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the borrowers shall take such steps as the lender shall reasonably request to assist the lender to recover such taxes. (h) any lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this section2.17 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its eurocurrency lending office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such lender. section 2.18.sharing of payments, etc. if any lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) owing to it on account of the revolving credit advances, swing line advances or the letters of credit (other than pursuant to section2.14, 2.17 or 9.04(c) or as otherwise provided herein) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of such extensions of credit obtained by all the lenders, such lender shall forthwith purchase from the other lenders such participations in such extensions of credit owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing lender, such purchase from each lender shall be rescinded and such lender shall repay to the purchasing lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such lenders ratable share (according to the proportion of (i)the amount of such lenders required repayment to (ii)the total amount so recovered from the purchasing lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. each borrower agrees that any lender so purchasing a participation from another lender pursuant to this section2.18 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such lender were the direct creditor of such borrower in the amount of such participation. section 2.19.use of proceeds. the proceeds of the advances, and letters of credit, shall be available (and each borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds and letters of credit) solely for general corporate purposes of the parent borrower and its subsidiaries. section 2.20.increase in aggregate commitments. (a) the parent borrower may, at any time but in any event not more than once in any calendar year prior to the termination date, by notice to the agent, request that the aggregate amount of the commitments be increased by an amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple thereof (each a commitment increase) to be effective as of a date that is at least 90 days prior to the scheduled termination date then in effect (the increase date) as specified in the related notice to the agent; provided, however that (i)in no event shall the aggregate amount of the commitments at any time exceed $2,500,000,000 and (ii)on the date of any request by the parent borrower for a commitment increase and on the related increase date the applicable conditions set forth in article iii shall be satisfied.  40 (b) the agent shall promptly notify such eligible assignees as the parent borrower may identify of a request by the parent borrower for a commitment increase, which notice shall include (i)the proposed amount of such requested commitment increase, (ii)the proposed increase date and (iii)the date by which lenders and other eligible assignees wishing to participate in the commitment increase must commit thereto (the commitment date). each lender that is willing to participate in such requested commitment increase (each an increasing lender) (it being understood that no lender shall have any obligation to participate in any increase described in this paragraph unless it agrees to do so in its sole discretion) and each other eligible assignee that agrees to participate in such requested commitment increase (each such eligible assignee, an assuming increasing lender) shall give written notice to the agent on or prior to the commitment date of the amount by which it is willing to participate in such commitment increase (each such amount, the designated increase). if the lenders and assuming increasing lenders notify the agent that they are willing to participate in the requested commitment increase by an aggregate amount that exceeds the amount of the requested commitment increase, the requested commitment increase shall be allocated among the lenders and such assuming increasing lenders in such amounts as are agreed between the parent borrower and the agent (so long as any allocation is not in excess of the designated increase of such increasing lender or assuming increasing lender); provided, however, that the commitment of each such assuming increasing lender shall be in an amount of $5,000,000 or more. (c) on each increase date, each assuming increasing lender shall become a lender party to this agreement as of such increase date and the commitment of each increasing lender for such requested commitment increase shall be so increased by such amount (or by the amount allocated to such lender pursuant to the last sentence of section2.20(b)) as of such increase date; provided, however, that the agent shall have received on or before such increase date the following, each dated such date: (i) (a) certified copies of resolutions of the board of directors of each borrower or a committee of each such board approving the commitment increase and the corresponding modifications to this agreement and (b)an opinion of counsel for the borrowers (which may be from in-house counsel), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the agent; (ii) an assumption agreement from each assuming increasing lender, if any, in substantially the form of exhibit d hereto (each an assumption agreement), duly executed by such eligible assignee, the agent, the issuing lenders and the parent borrower, as applicable; (iii) confirmation from each increasing lender of the increase in the amount of its commitment in a writing satisfactory to the parent borrower and the agent; and (iv) any other documents or instruments reasonably requested by the agent in connection with the commitment increase. (d) on each increase date, upon fulfillment of the conditions set forth in the immediately preceding sentence of this section2.20(c), the agent shall notify the lenders (including, without limitation, each assuming increasing lender) and the parent borrower, on or before 1:00 p.m. (new york city time), by fax, of the occurrence of the commitment increase to be effected on such increase date and shall record in the register the relevant information with respect to each increasing lender and each assuming increasing lender on such date. if any base rate advances are outstanding on the date of any increase date, the agent shall give appropriate notice to the increasing lenders and the assuming increasing lenders to fund their respective pro rata shares of such outstanding advances, and shall reallocate such advances among the lenders so that, after giving effect to such reallocation, each lender shall participate in each outstanding base rate borrowing ratably according to their respective commitments. if any eurocurrency rate advances are outstanding on the date of any increase date, the  41 agent shall, on the last day of the applicable interest periods, give appropriate notice to the increasing lenders and the assuming increasing lenders to fund their respective pro rata shares of such outstanding advances, and shall reallocate such advances among the lenders so that, after giving effect to such reallocation, each lender shall participate in such outstanding eurocurrency rate borrowing ratably according to their respective commitments. if any letters of credit or swing line advances are outstanding on any increase date, participations in such extensions of credit shall be deemed to be reallocated on such date according to the respective commitments of the lenders after giving effect to such increase. (e) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement, each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that, on each increase date, this agreement may be amended to the extent (but only to the extent (it being understood that the terms of any commitment increase shall be the same as the terms for the existing commitments)) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the commitment increase evidenced thereby. any such deemed amendment may be effected in writing by the agent with the parent borrowers consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and furnished to the other parties hereto. section 2.21.extension of termination date (a) request procedure. (i) borrower requests. the parent borrower, by written notice to the agent, may, (a)not more than two times after the first amendment effective date and (b)not less than twelve months after the prior extension date, if any, request an extension of the termination date in effect at such time by one year from its then scheduled expiration (the date of any such request, the extension request date); provided that such request is made at least 30 days prior to the applicable termination date. (ii) agent notification. the agent shall promptly notify each lender of such request, and, within 10 business days of the extension request date, each lender shall, in its sole discretion, notify the parent borrower and the agent in writing as to whether such lender will consent to such extension by delivering a notice of extension of termination date (with each lender consenting being a consenting lender and each lender not consenting being a non-consenting lender). if any lender shall fail to notify the agent and the parent borrower in writing of its consent to any such request for extension of the termination date prior to the end of such 10 business day period, such lender shall be deemed to be a non-consenting lender with respect to such request (it being understood that such lender may subsequently deliver a notice of extension of termination date, subject to the consent of the agent and parent borrower, or become an assuming extending lender pursuant to section2.21(c)). the agent shall notify the parent borrower in writing not later than 15 business days after the extension request date of the decision of the lenders regarding the parent borrowers request for an extension of the termination date. it is understood and agreed that no lender shall have any obligation whatsoever to agree to any request made by the parent borrower for any requested extension of the termination date. (b) conditions for extensions. the termination date in effect at such time shall, effective on any date as the parent borrower and agent may agree which occurs (x)on or prior to the then existing termination date and (y)within 60 days of the extension request date (such effective date, the extension date), be extended one year so long as (i)on the applicable extension date, the applicable conditions set forth in article iii are satisfied and (ii)not later than one business day prior to the applicable extension date, lenders having more than 50% of the commitments (after giving effect to any  42 assignments and assumptions pursuant to subsection (c)of this section2.21) shall have consented in writing to a requested extension (whether by execution or delivery of a notice of extension of termination date, an assumption agreement, an assignment and acceptance or other writing acceptable to the agent). the applicable termination date then in effect shall be extended for the additional one-year period as to the consenting lenders and assuming extended lenders in the applicable amount only and shall not be extended as to any non-consenting lender or consenting lender with respect to any amount of its commitment not extended. (c) assignment and assumption of commitments. if fewer than all of the lenders consent to any such request pursuant to subsection (a)of this section2.21, the agent shall promptly so notify the consenting lenders, and, at least 10 days prior to the applicable extension date (or such later date as the parent borrower and agent may agree), each consenting lender may, in its sole discretion, give written notice to the agent of the amount of the non-consenting lenders commitments and consenting lenders commitments which are not being extended for which it is willing to accept an assignment (such amount for each consenting lender, the designated amount). if the consenting lenders notify the agent in writing that they are willing to accept assignments of commitments such that, after giving effect to any assignments and assumptions pursuant to this section2.21(c), lenders having more than 50% of the commitments seek to extend the termination date, such commitments shall be allocated among the consenting lenders willing to accept such assignments in such amounts as are agreed between the parent borrower and the agent (so long as any allocation is not excess of the designated amount of such consenting lender) and the appropriate parties shall be deemed to have executed an assignment and acceptance giving effect to such allocations on the extension date. if, after giving effect to the assignments of commitments described directly above, there remain any commitments of non-consenting lenders or consenting lenders commitments which are not being extended, the parent borrower may arrange for one or more eligible assignees that agree to an extension of the termination date (each, an assuming extending lender) to assume (via an assignment or assumption), any non-consenting lenders commitment or consenting lenders commitments which are not being extended and all of the obligations of such non-consenting lender (or, with respect to such assigned or assumed commitments, of such consenting lender) under this agreement thereafter arising. any assignment or assumption by an assuming extending lender shall be without recourse to or warranty by, or expense to, such non-consenting lender (or, with respect to commitments of it which are being assigned or assumed, such consenting lender); provided, however, that the amount of the commitment of any such assuming extending lender as a result of such assumption shall in no event be less than $10,000,000 unless the amount of the commitment of such non-consenting lender or commitment of such consenting lender not being extended is less than $10,000,000, in which case such assuming extending lender shall assume all of such lesser amount; and provided further that: (i) any such assuming extending lender shall have, with respect to commitments that are the subject of an assignment or assumption, paid to such non-consenting lender or consenting lender, as the case may be, (a)the aggregate principal amount of, and any interest accrued and unpaid to the effective date of the assignment or assumption on, the outstanding advances, if any, of such non-consenting lender or consenting lender plus (b)any accrued but unpaid undrawn fees owing to such non-consenting lender or such consenting lender as of the effective date of such assignment or assumption; (ii) all additional costs, reimbursements, expense reimbursements and indemnities payable to such non-consenting lender or consenting lender, and all other accrued and unpaid amounts owing to such non-consenting lender hereunder, as of the effective date of such assignment shall have been paid to such non-consenting lender or consenting lender; and  43 (iii) with respect to any such assuming extending lender, the applicable processing and recordation fee required under section9.07(a) for such assignment or assumption shall have been paid by the assuming extending lender; provided further that such non-consenting lenders or consenting lenders rights under sections 2.14, 2.17 and 9.04, and its obligations under sections 2.06(j), 7.05 and 9.04(e), shall survive such assignment or assumption as to matters occurring prior to the date of such assignment or assumption. at least three business days prior to any extension date (or such shorter period as the parent borrower and agent may agree), (a)each assuming extending lender, if any, shall have delivered to the parent borrower and the agent an assumption agreement or an assignment and acceptance duly executed by such assuming extending lender, such non-consenting lender or consenting lender, as the case may be, the parent borrower and the agent and (b)each non-consenting lender being replaced pursuant to this section2.21(c) shall have delivered to the agent any note or notes held by such non-consenting lender, if requested by the parent borrower and agent. subject to (x)the payment or prepayment of all amounts referred to in clauses (i), (ii)and (iii)of the immediately preceding sentence, (y)the execution of an assumption agreement or an assignment and acceptance and (z)the conditions set forth in section2.21(b) being satisfied on the applicable extension date, each assuming extending lender, as of such extension date, will be a lender for all purposes of this agreement, without any further acknowledgment by or the consent of the other lenders, and, except as otherwise provided above, the obligations of each such non-consenting lender (or, with respect to commitments of it which are being assigned or assumed, such consenting lender) shall, by the provisions hereof, be released and discharged. (d) reserved. (e) actions undertaken upon extension. in the event of the occurrence of an extension date, (i) to the extent that the termination date is not extended as to any lender pursuant to this section2.21 and the commitment of such lender is not assigned or assumed in accordance with subsection (c)of this section2.21 on or prior to the applicable extension date, the commitment of such non-consenting lender or consenting lender not being extended shall automatically terminate in whole on such unextended termination date without any further notice or other action by the parent borrower, such lender or any other person; provided that such non-consenting lenders rights under sections 2.14, 2.17 and 9.04, and its obligations under sections 2.06(j), 7.05 and 9.04(e), shall survive the termination date for such lender as to matters occurring prior to such date; and (ii) all references in this agreement, and in the notes, if any, to the termination date shall, with respect to each consenting lender and each assuming extending lender for such extension date, refer to the termination date as so extended. promptly following each extension date, the agent shall notify the lenders (including, without limitation, each assuming extending lender) of the extension of the scheduled termination date in effect immediately prior thereto and shall thereupon record in the register the relevant information with respect to each such consenting lender and each such assuming extending lender. section 2.22. evidence of debt. (a) each lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each borrower to such lender resulting from each advance owing to such lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such lender from time to time hereunder in respect of advances. each borrower agrees that upon notice by any lender (with a copy of such notice to the agent) to the effect that a note is required or appropriate in order for such lender to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the advances to such borrower owing to, or to be made by, such lender, such borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such lender a note payable to the order of such lender in a principal amount up to the commitment of such lender.  44 (b) the register maintained by the agent pursuant to section9.07(d) shall include a control account, and a subsidiary account for each lender, in which accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i)the date and amount of each borrowing made hereunder, the type of advances comprising such borrowing, the name of the relevant borrower and, if appropriate, the interest period applicable thereto, (ii)the terms of each assumption agreement and each assignment and acceptance delivered to and accepted by it, (iii)the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each borrower to each lender hereunder and (iv)the amount of any sum received by the agent from each borrower hereunder and each lenders share thereof. (c) entries made in good faith by the agent in the register pursuant to subsection (b)above, and by each lender in its account or accounts pursuant to subsection (a)above, shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each borrower to, in the case of the register, each lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such lender, under this agreement, absent manifest error; provided, however, that the failure of the agent or such lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of any borrower under this agreement. section 2.23.foreign subsidiary borrowers. (a) subject to the consent of the agent, the parent borrower may designate any foreign subsidiary of the parent borrower as a foreign subsidiary borrower by delivery to the agent of a borrowing subsidiary agreement executed by such subsidiary, the parent borrower and the agent and upon such delivery such subsidiary shall for all purposes of this agreement be a foreign subsidiary borrower and a party to this agreement until the parent borrower shall have executed and delivered to the agent a borrowing subsidiary termination with respect to such subsidiary, whereupon such subsidiary shall cease to be a foreign subsidiary borrower. notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no such borrowing subsidiary termination will become effective as to any foreign subsidiary borrower at a time when any foreign borrower obligations of such foreign subsidiary borrower shall be outstanding hereunder or any letters of credit issued for the account of such foreign subsidiary borrower shall be outstanding (which shall not have been cash collateralized in a manner satisfactory to the agent), provided that such borrowing subsidiary termination shall be effective to terminate such foreign subsidiary borrowers right to make further borrowings hereunder.

(b) except as set forth in last sentence of section9.01, the commitment and extensions of credit of such defaulting lender shall not be included in determining whether all lenders, all affected lenders or the required lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to section9.01);

and; (d) so long as such lender is a defaulting lender, no swing line lender shall be required to fund any swing line advance and the issuing lender shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any letter of credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the defaulting lenders then outstanding l/c obligations will be 100% covered by the commitments of the non-defaulting lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the borrower in accordance with section2.26(c), and participating interests in any newly made swing line advance or any newly issued or increased letter of credit shall be allocated among non-defaulting lenders in a manner consistent with section2.26(c)(i) (and such defaulting lender shall not participate therein). if (i)a bankruptcy event with respect to a parent-of-a-lender shall occur following the date hereof and for so long as such event shall continue or (ii)any swing line lender or issuing lender has a good faith belief that any lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such lender commits to extend credit, such swing line lender shall not be required to fund any swing line advance and such issuing lender shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any letter of credit, unless such swing line lender or issuing lender, as the case may be, shall have entered into arrangements with the parent borrower or such lender, satisfactory to such swing line lender or issuing lender, as the case may be, to defease any risk to it in respect of such lender hereunder. in the event that the agent, the parent borrower, the applicable swing line lenders and the applicable issuing lenders each agrees that a defaulting lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such lender to be a defaulting lender, then the swing line advances and l/c obligations of the lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such lenders commitment and on such date such lender shall purchase at par such of the advances of the other lenders (other than competitive bid advances and swing line advances) as the agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such lender to hold such advances in accordance with its percentage.  47 article iii conditions to effectiveness and lending section 3.01.conditions precedent to effectiveness of sections 2.01, 2.03, 2.04 and 2.06 . sections 2.01, 2.03, 2.04 and 2.06 of this agreement shall become effective on and as of the first date (the effective date) on which the following conditions precedent have been satisfied: (a) as of the effective date, except as disclosed in the parent borrowers quarterly report on form 10-q for the quarter ending november30, 2010, since august31, 2010 there shall have occurred no material adverse change.

(a)if, due to either (i)the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law, rule, regulation or treaty or (ii)the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to any lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining eurodollar rate advances or agreeing to issue or of issuing or maintaining or participating in letters of credit (excluding for purposes of this section2.11 any such increased costs resulting from (i)taxes or other taxes (as to which section2.14 shall govern) or clauses (ii)-(iv)of the definition of excluded taxes and (ii)changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the united states or by the foreign jurisdiction or state under the laws of which such lender is organized or has its applicable lending office or any political subdivision thereof), then the borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by such lender (with a copy of such demand to the designated agent), pay to the designated agent for the account of such lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such lender for such increased cost; provided, however, that (i)before making any such demand, each lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different applicable lending office if the making of such a designation would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such increased cost and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such lender and (ii)such lender shall, in making demand under this section, certify that such lender is treating substantially all similarly situated borrowers in a manner that is consistent with the treatment afforded the borrower hereunder. a certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the borrower and the designated agent by such lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (b) if any lender determines that compliance with any law, rule, regulation or treaty or any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by  29 such lender or any corporation controlling such lender and that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such lenders commitment to lend hereunder and other commitments of this type, then, upon demand by such lender (with a copy of such demand to the designated agent), the borrower shall pay to the designated agent for the account of such lender, from time to time as specified by such lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such lender or such corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such lender reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such lenders commitment to lend hereunder; provided, however, that before making any such demand, each lender shall, in making demand under this section, certify that such lender is treating substantially all similarly situated borrowers in a manner that is consistent with the treatment afforded the borrower hereunder. a certificate as to such amounts submitted to the borrower and the designated agent by such lender shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (c) failure or delay on the part of any lender to demand compensation pursuant to this section shall not constitute a waiver of such lenders right to demand such compensation; provided that the borrower shall not be required to compensate a lender pursuant to this section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than six months prior to the date that such lender notifies the borrower of the change or circumstance giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such lenders intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the change or circumstance giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. any lender making a claim for compensation under this section2.11 may be required to assign all of its rights and obligations hereunder upon a request by the borrower in accordance with section2.21. (d) for the avoidance of doubt, this section2.11 shall apply to all requests, rules, guidelines or directives concerning capital adequacy issued in connection with the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives concerning capital adequacy promulgated by the bank for international settlements, the basel committee on banking supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the united states financial regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to basel iii, in each case, regardless of the date adopted, issued, promulgated or implemented. section 2.12. illegality. notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, if any lender shall notify the designated agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law, rule, regulation or treaty makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for any lender or its eurodollar lending office to perform its obligations hereunder to make eurodollar rate advances or to fund or maintain eurodollar rate advances hereunder, (a)each eurodollar rate advance will automatically, upon such demand, convert into a base rate advance, and (b)the obligation of the lenders to make eurodollar rate advances or to convert advances into eurodollar rate advances shall be suspended until the designated agent shall notify the borrower and the lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist; provided, however, that before making any such demand, each lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different eurodollar lending office if the making of such a designation would allow such lender or its eurodollar lending office to continue to perform its obligations to make eurodollar rate advances or to continue to fund or maintain eurodollar rate advances and would not, in the judgment of such lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such lender. any lender that is prohibited from performing its obligations to make eurodollar rate advances or to continue to fund or maintain eurodollar rate advances may be required to assign all of its rights and obligations hereunder upon a request by the borrower in accordance with section2.21.  30 section 2.13. payments and computations. (a)the borrower shall make each payment hereunder, irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off, not later than 11:00 a.m. (new york city time) on the day when due in dollars to the designated agent at the designated agents account in same day funds. the designated agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest, fees or commissions ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to section2.11, 2.14 or 9.04(d)) to the lenders for the account of their respective applicable lending offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any lender to such lender for the account of its applicable lending office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this agreement. upon any assuming lender becoming a lender hereunder as a result of a commitment increase pursuant to section2.18 or an extension of the termination date pursuant to section2.19, and upon the designated agents receipt of such lenders assumption agreement and recording of the information contained therein in the register, from and after the applicable increase date or extension date, as the case may be, the designated agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any notes issued in connection therewith in respect of the interest assumed thereby to the assuming lender. upon its acceptance of an assignment and assumption and recording of the information contained therein in the register pursuant to section9.07(c), from and after the effective date specified in such assignment and assumption, the designated agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such assignment and assumption shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves. (b) the borrower hereby authorizes each lender, if and to the extent payment owed to such lender is not made when due hereunder or under the note held by such lender, to charge from time to time against any or all of the borrowers accounts with such lender any amount so due to the fullest extent permitted by law. (c) all computations of interest based on the base rate shall be made by the designated agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the eurodollar rate or the federal funds rate and of fees and letter of credit commissions shall be made by the designated agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest, fees or commissions are payable. each determination by the designated agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (d) whenever any payment hereunder or under the notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a business day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding business day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or facility fee, as the case may be; provided, however, that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of eurodollar rate advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding business day. (e) unless the designated agent shall have received notice from the borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the lenders hereunder that the borrower will not make such payment in full, the designated agent may assume that the borrower has made such payment in full to the designated agent on such date and the designated agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such lender. if and to the extent the borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the designated agent, each lender shall repay to the designated agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such lender until the date such lender repays such amount to the designated agent, at the federal funds rate.  31 section 2.14. taxes. (a)any and all payments by the borrower to or for the account of any lender or the designated agent hereunder or under the notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder shall be made, in accordance with section2.13 or the applicable provisions of such other documents, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, deductions, charges or withholdings (including back-up withholding), assessments, fees or other charges imposed by any governmental authority, including any interest, additions to tax or penalties with respect thereto (taxes), unless otherwise required by applicable law. excluded taxes means in the case of each lender and the designated agent (i)taxes imposed on or measured by its net income (however denominated), franchise taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income taxes and branch profits taxes, in each case, (a)by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such lender or the designated agent (as the case may be) is organized or has its principal office or applicable lending office or any political subdivision thereof or (b)that are other connection taxes; (ii)in the case of a lender, any united states federal withholding taxes imposed on interest payable to or for the account of such lender pursuant to law in effect on the date on which such lender became a lender hereunder (except to the extent such taxes were not considered excluded taxes with respect to such lenders immediate assignor); (iii)taxes attributable to the recipients failure to comply with section2.14(e); and (iv)any united states withholding tax imposed under fatca in respect of payments hereunder or under the notes. if the borrower shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any note or any other documents to be delivered hereunder to any lender or the designated agent, (i)to the extent the tax is not an excluded tax, the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this section2.14) such lender or the designated agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii)the borrower shall make such deductions or withholdings and (iii)the borrower shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law. (b) in addition, the borrower shall pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or under the notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder or from the execution, delivery or registration of, performing under, or otherwise with respect to, this agreement or the notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder other than any taxes or other amounts imposed with respect to an assignment (hereinafter referred to as other taxes). (c) the borrower shall indemnify each lender and the designated agent for and hold it harmless against the full amount of taxes (other than excluded taxes) or other taxes (including, without limitation, taxes of any kind imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this section2.14) imposed on or paid by such lender or the designated agent (as the case may be) as a result of payments hereunder and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. this indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such lender or the designated agent (as the case may be) provides to the borrower a certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability. (d) within 30 days after the date of any payment of taxes, the borrower shall furnish to the designated agent, at its address referred to in section9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment to the extent such a receipt is issued therefor, or other written proof of payment thereof that is reasonably satisfactory to the designated agent. in the case of any payment hereunder or under the notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder by or on behalf of the  32 borrower through an account or branch outside the united states or by or on behalf of the borrower by a payor that is not a united states person, if the borrower determines that no taxes are payable in respect thereof, the borrower shall furnish, or shall cause such payor to furnish, to the designated agent, at such address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to the designated agent stating that such payment is exempt from taxes. for purposes of this subsection (d)and subsection (e), the terms united states and united states person shall have the meanings specified in section7701 of the internal revenue code. (e) (i) each lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the united states, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this agreement in the case of each initial lender and on the date of the assumption agreement or the assignment and assumption pursuant to which it becomes a lender in the case of each other lender, and from time to time thereafter as reasonably requested in writing by the borrower (but only so long as such lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the designated agent and the borrower with two original internal revenue service formsw-8ben, w-8imy or w-8eci, as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the internal revenue service, certifying that such lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of united states withholding tax on payments pursuant to this agreement or the notes. any lender claiming the benefits of the exemption of the portfolio interest under section871(h) or 881(c) of the code shall provide each of the designated agent and the borrower, in addition to the forms w-8ben provided pursuant to the preceding sentence, a certificate, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the borrower, to the effect that such lender is not a bank within the meaning of section881(c )(3)(c) of the internal revenue code. if the form provided by a lender at the time such lender first becomes a party to this agreement indicates a united states interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from taxes unless and until such lender provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate shall be considered excluded from taxes; provided, however, that, if at the date of the assumption agreement or the assignment and assumption pursuant to which a lender assignee becomes a party to this agreement, the lender assignor was entitled to payments under subsection(a) in respect of united states withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in taxes) united states withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the lender assignee on such date. (ii) if a payment made to a lender under any loan document would be subject to u.s. federal withholding tax imposed by fatca if such lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of fatca (including those contained in section1471(b) or 1472(b) of the internal revenue code, as applicable), such lender shall deliver to the borrower and the designated agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the borrower or the designated agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by section1471(b)(3)(c)(i) of the internal revenue code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the borrower or the designated agent as may be necessary for the borrower and the designated agent to comply with their obligations under fatca and to determine that such lender has complied with such lenders obligations under fatca or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. solely for purposes of this clause (ii), fatca shall include any amendments made to fatca after the date of this agreement. (iii) each lender that is a united states person, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this agreement in the case of each initial lender and on the date of the assumption agreement or the assignment and assumption pursuant to which it becomes a lender in the case of each other lender, and from time to time thereafter as reasonably requested in writing by the borrower (but only so long as such lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the designated agent and the borrower with two original internal revenue service forms w-9, or any successor or other form prescribed by the internal revenue service, certifying that such lender is exempt from united states federal backup withholding tax.  33 (iv) each lender agrees that if any form or certification previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the borrower and the designated agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. (f) for any period with respect to which a lender has failed to provide the borrower with the appropriate form, certificate or other document described in section2.14(e) (other than if such failure is due to a change in law, or in the interpretation or application thereof, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form, certificate or other document originally was required to be provided, or if such form, certificate or other document otherwise is not required under subsection(e) above), such lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under section2.14(a) or (c)with respect to taxes imposed by the united states by reason of such failure; provided, however, that should a lender become subject to taxes because of its failure to deliver a form, certificate or other document required hereunder, the borrower shall take such steps as the lender shall reasonably request to assist the lender to recover such taxes. (g) any lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this section2.14 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its eurodollar lending office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such lender. (h) any lender making a claim for compensation under this section2.14 may be required to assign all of its rights and obligations hereunder upon a request by the borrower in accordance with section2.21. (i) in the event a lender is entitled, on the effective date of an assumption agreement or assignment or acceptance, to the benefits of a payment pursuant to this section2.14, an assignee or novatee of such lender shall be entitled to the same benefits of payment (in addition to any future benefits of payment that may arise with respect to such assignee) that would have been available to such lender had such lender not entered into the related assumption agreement or assignment and assumption with such assignee or novatee and then only to the extent the relevant amounts are incurred by such assignee or novatee. (j) if any lender or designated agent (for purposes of this paragraph (j), an indemnified party) determines, in its sole discretion (such discretion to be exercised in good faith), that it has received a refund of any taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this section2.14 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this section2.14), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this section with respect to the taxes giving rise to such refund). such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (j)(plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such governmental authority. this paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it reasonably deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other person. section 2.15. sharing of payments, etc. if any lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its advances or other obligations  34 hereunder resulting in such lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its advances and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a)notify the designated agent of such fact, and (b)purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the advances and such other obligations of the other lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective advances and other amounts owing them; provided that: (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (x)any payment made by the borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a defaulting lender), or (y)any payment obtained by a lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its advances to any assignee or participant, other than to the borrower or any subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). each loan party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each loan party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such lender were a direct creditor of each loan party in the amount of such participation. section 2.16. evidence of debt. (a)each lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the borrower to such lender resulting from each advance owing to such lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such lender from time to time hereunder in respect of advances. the borrower agrees that upon notice by any lender to the borrower (with a copy of such notice to the designated agent) to the effect that a note is required or appropriate in order for such lender to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the advances owing to, or to be made by, such lender, the borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such lender a note payable to the order of such lender in a principal amount up to the revolving credit commitment of such lender.

(d)unless the designated agent shall have received notice from a lender prior to the date of any borrowing that such lender will not make available to the designated agent such lenders ratable portion of such borrowing, the designated agent may assume that such lender has made such portion available to the designated agent on the date of such borrowing in accordance with subsection(a) of this section2.02 and the designated agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the borrower on such date a corresponding amount. if and to the extent that such lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the designated agent, such lender and  22 the borrower severally agree to repay to the designated agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the designated agent, at (i)in the case of the borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to advances comprising such borrowing and (ii)in the case of such lender, the federal funds rate. if such lender shall repay to the designated agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such lenders advance as part of such borrowing for purposes of this agreement (and any interest paid by such lender shall be paid to the borrower for any period where the borrower has made payments under this subsection).

(ii)no issuing bank shall be under any obligation to issue any letter of credit if: (a)any order, judgment or decree of any governmental authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such issuing bank from issuing such letter of credit, or any law applicable to such issuing bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any governmental authority with jurisdiction over such issuing bank shall prohibit, or request that such issuing bank refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or the letter of credit in particular or shall impose upon such issuing bank with respect to the letter of credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which such issuing bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the effective date, or shall impose upon such issuing bank any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the effective date and which such issuing bank in good faith deems material to it; or (b)the issuance of the letter of credit would violate one or more policies of such issuing bank applicable to letters of credit generally and to customers of the issuing bank generally; provided that, in the event the issuing bank can no longer issue any letter of credit, the issuing bank shall endeavor to provide sufficient notice thereof to the borrower.  23 (b)participations. by the issuance of a letter of credit (or an amendment to a letter of credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable issuing bank or the lenders, such issuing bank hereby grants to each lender, and each lender hereby acquires from such issuing bank, a participation in such letter of credit equal to such lenders pro rata share of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such letter of credit. the borrower hereby agrees to each such participation. in consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the designated agent, for the account of such issuing bank, such lenders pro rata share of each drawing made under a letter of credit funded by such issuing bank and not reimbursed by the borrower within one business day after the borrowers receipt of notice thereof, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the borrower for any reason. each lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of letters of credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any letter of credit or the occurrence and continuance of a default or reduction or termination of the revolving credit commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. each lender further acknowledges and agrees that its participation in each letter of credit will be automatically adjusted to reflect such lenders pro rata share of the available amount of such letter of credit at each time such lenders revolving credit commitment is amended pursuant to a commitment increase in accordance with section2.18, an assignment in accordance with section2.19 or section9.07 or otherwise pursuant to this agreement.

(d)letter of credit reports. each issuing bank shall furnish (i)to the designated agent and each lender on the first business day of each month a written report summarizing issuance and expiration dates of letters of credit during the preceding month and drawings during such month under all letters of credit and (ii)to the designated agent and each lender on the first business day of each calendar quarter a written report setting forth the average daily aggregate available amount during the preceding calendar quarter of all letters of credit.

(a)the borrower shall make each payment hereunder, irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off, not later than 11:00 a.m. (new york city time) on the day when due in dollars to the designated agent at the designated agents account in same day funds. the designated agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest, fees or commissions ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to section2.11, 2.14 or 9.04(d)) to the lenders for the account of their respective applicable lending offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any lender to such lender for the account of its applicable lending office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this agreement. upon any assuming lender becoming a lender hereunder as a result of a commitment increase pursuant to section2.18 or an extension of the termination date pursuant to section2.19, and upon the designated agents receipt of such lenders assumption agreement and recording of the information contained therein in the register, from and after the applicable increase date or extension date, as the case may be, the designated agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any notes issued in connection therewith in respect of the interest assumed thereby to the assuming lender. upon its acceptance of an assignment and assumption and recording of the information contained therein in the register pursuant to section9.07(c), from and after the effective date specified in such assignment and assumption, the designated agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such assignment and assumption shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves. (b)the borrower hereby authorizes each lender, if and to the extent payment owed to such lender is not made when due hereunder or under the note held by such lender, to charge from time to time against any or all of the borrowers accounts with such lender any amount so due to the fullest extent permitted by law. (c)all computations of interest based on the base rate shall be made by the designated agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the eurodollar rate or the federal funds rate and of fees and letter of credit commissions shall be made by the designated agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest, fees or commissions are payable. each determination by the designated agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (d)whenever any payment hereunder or under the notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a business day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding business day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or facility fee, as the case may be; provided, however, that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of eurodollar rate advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding business day. (e)unless the designated agent shall have received notice from the borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the lenders hereunder that the borrower will not make such payment in full, the designated agent may assume that the borrower has made such payment in full to the designated agent on such date and the designated agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such lender. if and to the extent the borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the designated agent, each lender shall repay to the designated agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such lender until the date such lender repays such amount to the designated agent, at the federal funds rate.  32 section 2.14. taxes. (a)any and all payments by the borrower to or for the account of any lender or the designated agent hereunder or under the notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder shall be made, in accordance with section2.13 or the applicable provisions of such other documents, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, deductions, charges or withholdings (including back-up withholding), assessments, fees or other charges imposed by any governmental authority, including any interest, additions to tax or penalties with respect thereto (taxes), unless otherwise required by applicable law. excluded taxes means in the case of each lender and the designated agent (i)taxes imposed on or measured by its net income (however denominated), franchise taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income taxes and branch profits taxes, in each case, (a)by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such lender or the designated agent (as the case may be) is organized or has its principal office or applicable lending office or any political subdivision thereof or (b)that are other connection taxes; (ii)in the case of a lender, any united states federal withholding taxes imposed on interest payable to or for the account of such lender pursuant to law in effect on the date on which such lender became a lender hereunder (except to the extent such taxes were not considered excluded taxes with respect to such lenders immediate assignor); (iii)taxes attributable to the recipients failure to comply with section2.14(e); and (iv)any united states withholding tax imposed under fatca in respect of payments hereunder or under the notes. if the borrower shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any note or any other documents to be delivered hereunder to any lender or the designated agent, (i)to the extent the tax is not an excluded tax, the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this section2.14) such lender or the designated agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii)the borrower shall make such deductions or withholdings and (iii)the borrower shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law. (b)in addition, the borrower shall pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or under the notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder or from the execution, delivery or registration of, performing under, or otherwise with respect to, this agreement or the notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder other than any taxes or other amounts imposed with respect to an assignment (other taxes). (c)the borrower shall indemnify each lender and the designated agent for and hold it harmless against the full amount of taxes (other than excluded taxes) or other taxes (including, without limitation, taxes of any kind imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this section2.14) imposed on or paid by such lender or the designated agent (as the case may be) as a result of payments hereunder and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. this indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such lender or the designated agent (as the case may be) provides to the borrower a certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability. (d)within 30 days after the date of any payment of taxes, the borrower shall furnish to the designated agent, at its address referred to in section9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment to the extent such a receipt is issued therefor, or other written proof  33 of payment thereof that is reasonably satisfactory to the designated agent. in the case of any payment hereunder or under the notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder by or on behalf of the borrower through an account or branch outside the united states or by or on behalf of the borrower by a payor that is not a united states person, if the borrower determines that no taxes are payable in respect thereof, the borrower shall furnish, or shall cause such payor to furnish, to the designated agent, at such address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to the designated agent stating that such payment is exempt from taxes. for purposes of this subsection (d)and subsection (e), the terms united states and united states person shall have the meanings specified in section7701 of the internal revenue code. (e)(i) each lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the united states, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this agreement in the case of each initial lender and on the date of the assumption agreement or the assignment and assumption pursuant to which it becomes a lender in the case of each other lender, and from time to time thereafter as reasonably requested in writing by the borrower (but only so long as such lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the designated agent and the borrower with two original internal revenue service formsw-8ben, w8ben-e, w-8imy or w-8eci, as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the internal revenue service, certifying that such lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of united states withholding tax on payments pursuant to this agreement or the notes. any lender claiming the benefits of the exemption of the portfolio interest under section871(h) or 881(c) of the internal revenue code shall provide each of the designated agent and the borrower, in addition to the forms w-8ben or w-8ben-e provided pursuant to the preceding sentence, a certificate, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the borrower, to the effect that such lender is not a bank within the meaning of section881(c)(3)(a) of the internal revenue code, a 10% shareholder within the meaning of sections 881(c)(3)(b) or 871(h)(3)(b) of the internal revenue code, or a controlled foreign corporation related to the borrower within the meaning of section881(c )(3)(c) of the internal revenue code. if the form provided by a lender at the time such lender first becomes a party to this agreement indicates a united states interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered an excluded tax unless and until such lender provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate shall be considered an excluded tax; provided, however, that, if at the date of the assumption agreement or the assignment and assumption pursuant to which a lender assignee becomes a party to this agreement, the lender assignor was entitled to payments under subsection(a) in respect of united states federal withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in taxes) united states federal withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the lender assignee on such date. (ii)if a payment made to a lender under any loan document would be subject to u.s. federal withholding tax imposed by fatca if such lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of fatca (including those contained in section1471(b) or 1472(b) of the internal revenue code, as applicable), such lender shall deliver to the borrower and the designated agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the borrower or the designated agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by section1471(b)(3)(c)(i) of the internal revenue code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the borrower or the designated agent as may be necessary for the borrower and the designated agent to comply with their obligations under fatca and to determine that such lender has complied with such lenders obligations under fatca or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. solely for purposes of this clause (ii), fatca shall include any amendments made to fatca after the date of this agreement.  34 (iii)each lender that is a united states person, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this agreement in the case of each initial lender and on the date of the assumption agreement or the assignment and assumption pursuant to which it becomes a lender in the case of each other lender, and from time to time thereafter as reasonably requested in writing by the borrower (but only so long as such lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the designated agent and the borrower with two original internal revenue service forms w-9, or any successor or other form prescribed by the internal revenue service, certifying that such lender is exempt from united states federal backup withholding tax. (iv)each lender agrees that if any form or certification previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the borrower and the designated agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. (f)for any period with respect to which a lender has failed to provide the borrower with the appropriate form, certificate or other document described in section2.14(e) (other than if such failure is due to a change in law, or in the interpretation or application thereof, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form, certificate or other document originally was required to be provided, or if such form, certificate or other document otherwise is not required under subsection(e) above), such lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under section2.14(a) or (c)with respect to taxes imposed by the united states by reason of such failure; provided, however, that should a lender become subject to taxes because of its failure to deliver a form, certificate or other document required hereunder, the borrower shall take such steps as the lender shall reasonably request to assist the lender to recover such taxes. (g)any lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this section2.14 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its eurodollar lending office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such lender. (h)any lender making a claim for compensation under this section2.14 may be required to assign all of its rights and obligations hereunder upon a request by the borrower in accordance with section2.21. (i)in the event a lender is entitled, on the effective date of an assumption agreement or assignment and assumption, to the benefits of a payment pursuant to this section2.14, an assignee or novatee of such lender shall be entitled to the same benefits of payment (in addition to any future benefits of payment that may arise with respect to such assignee) that would have been available to such lender had such lender not entered into the related assumption agreement or assignment and assumption with such assignee or novatee and then only to the extent the relevant amounts are incurred by such assignee or novatee. (j)if any lender or designated agent (for purposes of this paragraph (j), an indemnified party) determines, in its sole discretion (such discretion to be exercised in good faith), that it has received a refund of any taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this section2.14 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this section2.14), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this section with respect to the taxes giving rise to such refund). such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (j)(plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such governmental authority. this paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it reasonably deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other person.  35 (k)for purposes of determining withholding taxes imposed under fatca, from and after the effective date of this agreement, the borrower and the designated agent shall treat (and the lenders hereby authorize the designated agent to treat) this amendment and restatement of the existing credit agreement and the advances as not qualifying as a grandfathered obligation within the meaning of treasury regulation section1.1471-2(b)(2)(i). section 2.15. sharing of payments, etc. if any lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its advances or other obligations hereunder resulting in such lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its advances and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a)notify the designated agent of such fact, and (b)purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the advances and such other obligations of the other lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective advances and other amounts owing them; provided that: (i)if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and (ii)the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (x)any payment made by the borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a defaulting lender), or (y)any payment obtained by a lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its advances to any assignee or participant, other than to the borrower or any subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). each loan party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each loan party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such lender were a direct creditor of each loan party in the amount of such participation. section 2.16. evidence of debt. (a)each lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the borrower to such lender resulting from each advance owing to such lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such lender from time to time hereunder in respect of advances. the borrower agrees that upon notice by any lender to the borrower (with a copy of such notice to the designated agent) to the effect that a note is required or appropriate in order for such lender to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the advances owing to, or to be made by, such lender, the borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such lender a note payable to the order of such lender in a principal amount up to the revolving credit commitment of such lender. (b)the register maintained by the designated agent pursuant to section9.07(c) shall include a control account, and a subsidiary account for each lender, in which accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i)the date and amount of each borrowing made hereunder, the type of advances comprising such borrowing and, if appropriate, the interest period applicable thereto, (ii)the terms of each assumption agreement and each assignment and assumption delivered to and accepted by it, (iii)the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the borrower to each lender hereunder and (iv)the amount of any sum received by the designated agent from the borrower hereunder and each lenders share thereof.  36 (c)entries made in good faith by the designated agent in the register pursuant to subsection (b)above, and by each lender in its account or accounts pursuant to subsection (a)above, shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the borrower to, in the case of the register, each lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such lender, under this agreement, absent manifest error; provided, however, that the failure of the designated agent or such lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the borrower under this agreement. section 2.17. use of proceeds. the proceeds of the advances shall be available (and the borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds) solely for general corporate purposes of the borrower and its subsidiaries. section 2.18. increase in the aggregate revolving credit commitments. (a)the borrower may, at any time prior to the final termination date, by notice to the designated agent, request that the aggregate amount of the revolving credit commitment be increased by an amount of $25,000,000 or an integral multiple thereof (each a commitment increase) to be effective as of a date that is at least 90 days prior to the scheduled final termination date then in effect (the increase date) as specified in the related notice to the designated agent; provided, however that (i)in no event shall the aggregate amount of the revolving credit commitments at any time exceed $2,000,000,000 and (ii)on the date of any request by the borrower for a commitment increase and on the related increase date, the applicable conditions set forth in article iii shall be satisfied. the borrower may simultaneously (x)request one or more of the lenders to increase the amount of its commitment and/or (y)arrange for one or more banks or financial institutions not a party hereto to become parties to and lenders under this agreement, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth below. (b)the designated agent shall promptly notify such of the lenders and one or more eligible assignees as are identified by the borrower to receive the invitation to participate in the requested commitment increase of a request by the borrower for a commitment increase, which notice shall include (i)the proposed amount of such requested commitment increase, (ii)the proposed increase date and (iii)the date by which such lenders or eligible assignees (each such eligible assignee and each eligible assignee that agrees to an extension of the termination date in accordance with section2.19(c), an assuming lender) wishing to participate in the commitment increase must commit to increase the amount of their respective revolving credit commitments or to establish their respective revolving credit commitments, as the case may be (the commitment date); provided, however, that the revolving credit commitment of each such eligible assignee shall be in an amount of $5,000,000 or more. each lender that is willing to participate in such requested commitment increase (each an increasing lender) shall, in its sole discretion, give written notice to the designated agent on or prior to the commitment date of the amount by which it is willing to increase its revolving credit commitment. each increase in the revolving credit commitments of the increasing lenders and the revolving credit commitment of each assuming lender shall be subject to the approval of each issuing bank (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). the requested commitment increase shall be allocated among the lenders willing to participate therein and the assuming lenders in such amounts as are agreed between the borrower and the designated agent.  37 (c)on each increase date, each assuming lender shall become a lender party to this agreement as of such increase date and the revolving credit commitment of each increasing lender for such requested commitment increase shall be so increased by such amount (or by the amount allocated to such lender pursuant to the last sentence of section2.18(b)) as of such increase date; provided, however, that the designated agent shall have received on or before such increase date the following, each dated such date: (i)(a) certified copies of resolutions of the board of directors of the borrower or the executive committee of such board of directors approving the commitment increase and the corresponding modifications to this agreement, (b)if reasonably requested by the designated agent, an opinion of counsel for the borrower (which may be in-house counsel), and (c)a consent of the parent guarantor; (ii)an assumption agreement from each assuming lender, if any, in form and substance satisfactory to the borrower and the designated agent (each an assumption agreement), duly executed by such eligible assignee, the designated agent and the borrower; and (iii)confirmation from each increasing lender of the increase in the amount of its revolving credit commitment in a writing satisfactory to the borrower and the designated agent. on each increase date, upon fulfillment of the conditions set forth in section2.18(a) and in the immediately preceding sentence of this section2.18(c), the designated agent shall notify the lenders (including, without limitation, each assuming lender) and the borrower of the occurrence of the commitment increase to be effected on such increase date and shall record in the register the relevant information with respect to each increasing lender and each assuming lender on such date. if any advances are outstanding on the increase date, the lenders immediately after effectiveness of such commitment increase shall purchase and assign at par such amounts of the advances outstanding at such time as the designated agent may require such that each lender holds its pro rata share of all advances outstanding after giving effect to all such assignments. on and after each increase date, the pro rata share of each lenders participation in letters of credit and advances from draws under letters of credit shall be calculated after giving effect to each such commitment increase. section 2.19. extension of termination date. (a)at least 45 days but not more than 90 days prior to any anniversary of the effective date, the borrower, by written notice to the designated agent, may request an extension of the termination date in effect at such time by one year from its then scheduled expiration; provided the final termination date may not extend more than two years from the initial termination date. the designated agent shall promptly notify each lender of such request, and each lender shall in turn, in its sole discretion, not later than 20 days prior to such anniversary date, notify the borrower and the designated agent in writing as to whether such lender will consent to such extension. if any lender shall fail to notify the designated agent and the borrower in writing of its consent to any such request for extension of the termination date at least 20 days prior to the applicable anniversary date, such lender shall be deemed to be a non-consenting lender with respect to such request. the designated agent shall notify the borrower not later than 15 days prior to the applicable anniversary date of the decision of the lenders regarding the borrowers request for an extension of the termination date. (b)if all the lenders consent in writing to any such request in accordance with subsection (a)of this section2.19, the termination date in effect at such time shall, effective as at the applicable anniversary date (the extension date), be extended for one year; provided that on each extension date the applicable conditions set forth in article iii shall be satisfied. if less than all of the lenders consent in writing to any such request in accordance with subsection (a)of this section2.19, the  38 termination date in effect at such time shall, effective as at the applicable extension date and subject to subsection (d)of this section2.19, be extended as to those lenders that so consented (each a consenting lender) but shall not be extended as to any other lender (each a non-consenting lender). to the extent that the termination date is not extended as to any lender pursuant to this section2.19 and the revolving credit commitment of such lender is not assumed in accordance with subsection (c)of this section2.19 on or prior to the applicable extension date, the revolving credit commitment of such non-consenting lender shall automatically terminate in whole on such unextended termination date without any further notice or other action by the borrower, such lender or any other person; provided that such non-consenting lenders rights under sections 2.11, 2.14 and 9.04, and its obligations under section9.16, shall survive the termination date for such lender as to matters occurring prior to such date. it is understood and agreed that no lender shall have any obligation whatsoever to agree to any request made by the borrower for any requested extension of the termination date. (c)if less than all of the lenders consent to any such request pursuant to subsection (a)of this section2.19, the designated agent shall promptly so notify the borrower. the borrower may arrange for one or more consenting lenders or other eligible assignees as assuming lenders to assume, pursuant to assignments and assumptions, effective as of the extension date, any non-consenting lenders revolving credit commitment and all of the obligations of such non-consenting lender under this agreement thereafter arising, without recourse to or warranty by, or expense to, such non-consenting lender (with such revolving credit commitment to replace the revolving credit commitment of any non-consenting lender as designated by the borrower); provided, however, that (x)the amount of the revolving credit commitment of any such assuming lender as a result of such substitution shall in no event be less than $5,000,000 unless the amount of the commitment of such non-consenting lender is less than $5,000,000, in which case such assuming lender shall assume all of such lesser amount and (y)each increase in the revolving credit commitment of the consenting lenders shall be approved by each issuing bank (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and provided further that: (i)any such consenting lender or assuming lender shall have paid to such non-consenting lender (a)the aggregate principal amount of, and any interest accrued and unpaid to the effective date of the assignment on, the outstanding advances, if any, of such non-consenting lender plus (b)any accrued but unpaid facility fees owing to such non-consenting lender as of the effective date of such assignment; (ii)all additional costs, reimbursements, expense reimbursements and indemnities payable to such non-consenting lender, and all other accrued and unpaid amounts owing to such non-consenting lender hereunder, as of the effective date of such assignment shall have been paid to such non-consenting lender; and (iii)with respect to any such assuming lender, the applicable processing and recordation fee required under section9.07(a) for such assignment shall have been paid; provided further that such non-consenting lenders rights under sections 2.11, 2.14 and 9.04, and its obligations under section9.16, shall survive such substitution as to matters occurring prior to the date of substitution. at least three business days prior to any extension date, (a)each such assuming lender, if any, shall have delivered to the borrower and the designated agent an assumption agreement, duly executed by such assuming lender, such non-consenting lender, the borrower and the designated agent, (b)any such consenting lender shall have delivered confirmation in writing satisfactory to the borrower and the designated agent as to the increase in the amount of its revolving credit commitment and (c)each non-consenting lender being replaced pursuant to this section2.19 shall have delivered to the designated agent any note or notes held by such non-consenting lender. upon the payment or  39 prepayment of all amounts referred to in clauses (i), (ii)and (iii)of the immediately preceding sentence, each such consenting lender or assuming lender, as of the extension date, will be substituted for such non-consenting lender under this agreement and shall be a lender for all purposes of this agreement, without any further acknowledgment by or the consent of the other lenders, and the obligations of each such non-consenting lender hereunder (other than its obligations under section9.16 as to matters occurring prior to such date) shall, by the provisions hereof, be released and discharged. (d)if (after giving effect to any assignments or assumptions pursuant to subsection (c)of this section2.19) lenders having commitments equal to at least 50% of the revolving credit commitments in effect immediately prior to the extension date consent in writing to a requested extension (whether by execution or delivery of an assumption agreement or otherwise) not later than one business day prior to such extension date, the designated agent shall so notify the borrower, and, subject to the satisfaction of the applicable conditions in article iii, the termination date then in effect for each such lender shall be extended for the additional one-year period as described in subsection (a)of this section2.19, and all references in this agreement, and in the notes, if any, to the termination date shall, with respect to each consenting lender and each assuming lender for such extension date, refer to the termination date as so extended. promptly following each extension date, the designated agent shall notify the lenders (including, without limitation, each assuming lender) of the extension of the scheduled termination date in effect immediately prior thereto and shall thereupon record in the register the relevant information with respect to each such consenting lender and each such assuming lender.

(i)if the designated agent notifies the borrower on the second business day prior to any interest payment date that the sum of (a)the aggregate principal amount of all advances then outstanding plus (b)the aggregate available amount of all letters of credit denominated in dollars then outstanding plus (c)the dollar equivalent in (determined on the third business day prior to such interest payment date) of the aggregate available amount of all letters of credit denominated in euros then outstanding exceeds 103% of the aggregate revolving credit commitments of the lenders on such date, the borrower shall, within two business days after receipt of such notice, prepay the outstanding principal amount of any advances owing by the borrower in an aggregate amount sufficient to reduce such sum after such payment to an amount not to exceed 100% of the aggregate revolving credit commitments of the lenders. the designated agent shall provide such notice to the borrower at the request of any lender.  29 (ii)each prepayment made pursuant to this section2.10(b) shall be made together with any interest accrued to the date of such prepayment on the principal amounts prepaid and, in the case of any prepayment of a eurodollar rate advance on a date other than the last day of an interest period or at its maturity, any additional amounts which the borrower shall be obligated to reimburse to the lenders in respect thereof pursuant to section9.04(d). the designated agent shall give prompt notice of any prepayment required under this section2.10(b) to the borrower and the lenders.

(a)if, due to either (i)the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law, rule, regulation or treaty or (ii)the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to any lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining eurodollar rate advances or agreeing to issue or of issuing or maintaining or participating in letters of credit (excluding for purposes of this section2.11 any such increased costs resulting from (i)taxes or other taxes (as to which section2.14 shall govern) or clauses (ii)-(iv)of the definition of excluded taxes and (ii)changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the united states or by the foreign jurisdiction or state under the laws of which such lender is organized or has its applicable lending office or any political subdivision thereof), then the borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by such lender (with a copy of such demand to the designated agent), pay to the designated agent for the account of such lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such lender for such increased cost; provided, however, that (i)before making any such demand, each lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different applicable lending office if the making of such a designation would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such increased cost and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such lender and (ii)such lender shall, in making demand under this section, certify that such lender is treating substantially all similarly situated borrowers in a manner that is consistent with the treatment afforded the borrower hereunder. a certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the borrower and the designated agent by such lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.  30 (b)if any lender determines that compliance with any law, rule, regulation or treaty or any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or would affect the amount of capital or liquidity required or expected to be maintained by such lender or any corporation controlling such lender and that the amount of such capital or liquidity is increased by or based upon the existence of such lenders commitment to lend or to issue or participate in letters of credit hereunder and other commitments of such type or the issuance or maintenance of or participation in the letters of credit (or similar contingent obligations), then, upon demand by such lender (with a copy of such demand to the designated agent), the borrower shall pay to the designated agent for the account of such lender, from time to time as specified by such lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such lender or such corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such lender reasonably determines such increase in capital or liquidity to be allocable to the existence of such lenders commitment to lend or to issue or participate in letters of credit hereunder or to the issuance or maintenance of or participation in any letters of credit; provided, however, that before making any such demand, each lender shall, in making demand under this section, certify that such lender is treating substantially all similarly situated borrowers in a manner that is consistent with the treatment afforded the borrower hereunder. a certificate as to such amounts submitted to the borrower and the designated agent by such lender shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (c)failure or delay on the part of any lender to demand compensation pursuant to this section shall not constitute a waiver of such lenders right to demand such compensation; provided that the borrower shall not be required to compensate a lender pursuant to this section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than six months prior to the date that such lender notifies the borrower of the change or circumstance giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such lenders intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the change or circumstance giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. any lender making a claim for compensation under this section2.11 may be required to assign all of its rights and obligations hereunder upon a request by the borrower in accordance with section2.21. (d)for the avoidance of doubt, this section2.11 shall apply to all requests, rules, guidelines or directives concerning capital adequacy or liquidity issued in connection with the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives concerning capital adequacy or liquidity promulgated by the bank for international settlements, the basel committee on banking supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the united states financial regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to basel iii, in each case, regardless of the date adopted, issued, promulgated or implemented. section 2.12. illegality. notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, if any lender shall notify the designated agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law, rule, regulation or treaty makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for any lender or its eurodollar lending office to perform its obligations hereunder to make eurodollar rate advances or to fund or maintain eurodollar rate advances hereunder, (a)each eurodollar rate advance will automatically, upon such demand, convert into a base rate advance, and (b)the obligation of the lenders to make eurodollar rate advances or to convert advances into eurodollar rate advances shall be suspended until the designated agent shall notify the borrower and the lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist; provided, however, that before making any such demand, each lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different eurodollar lending office if the making of such a designation would allow such lender or its eurodollar lending office to continue to perform its obligations to make eurodollar rate advances or to continue to fund or maintain eurodollar rate advances and would not, in the judgment of such lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such lender. any lender that is prohibited from performing its obligations to make eurodollar rate advances or to continue to fund or maintain eurodollar rate advances may be required to assign all of its rights and obligations hereunder upon a request by the borrower in accordance with section2.21.  31 section 2.13. payments and computations. (a)the borrower shall make each payment hereunder, irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off, not later than 11:00 a.m. (new york city time) on the day when due in dollars to the designated agent at the designated agents account in same day funds. the designated agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest, fees or commissions ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to section2.11, 2.14 or 9.04(d)) to the lenders for the account of their respective applicable lending offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any lender to such lender for the account of its applicable lending office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this agreement. upon any assuming lender becoming a lender hereunder as a result of a commitment increase pursuant to section2.18 or an extension of the termination date pursuant to section2.19, and upon the designated agents receipt of such lenders assumption agreement and recording of the information contained therein in the register, from and after the applicable increase date or extension date, as the case may be, the designated agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any notes issued in connection therewith in respect of the interest assumed thereby to the assuming lender. upon its acceptance of an assignment and assumption and recording of the information contained therein in the register pursuant to section9.07(c), from and after the effective date specified in such assignment and assumption, the designated agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such assignment and assumption shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves. (b)the borrower hereby authorizes each lender, if and to the extent payment owed to such lender is not made when due hereunder or under the note held by such lender, to charge from time to time against any or all of the borrowers accounts with such lender any amount so due to the fullest extent permitted by law. (c)all computations of interest based on the base rate shall be made by the designated agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the eurodollar rate or the federal funds rate and of fees and letter of credit commissions shall be made by the designated agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest, fees or commissions are payable. each determination by the designated agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (d)whenever any payment hereunder or under the notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a business day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding business day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or facility fee, as the case may be; provided, however, that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of eurodollar rate advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding business day. (e)unless the designated agent shall have received notice from the borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the lenders hereunder that the borrower will not make such payment in full, the designated agent may assume that the borrower has made such payment in full to the designated agent on such date and the designated agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such lender. if and to the extent the borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the designated agent, each lender shall repay to the designated agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such lender until the date such lender repays such amount to the designated agent, at the federal funds rate.  32 section 2.14. taxes. (a)any and all payments by the borrower to or for the account of any lender or the designated agent hereunder or under the notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder shall be made, in accordance with section2.13 or the applicable provisions of such other documents, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, deductions, charges or withholdings (including back-up withholding), assessments, fees or other charges imposed by any governmental authority, including any interest, additions to tax or penalties with respect thereto (taxes), unless otherwise required by applicable law. excluded taxes means in the case of each lender and the designated agent (i)taxes imposed on or measured by its net income (however denominated), franchise taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income taxes and branch profits taxes, in each case, (a)by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such lender or the designated agent (as the case may be) is organized or has its principal office or applicable lending office or any political subdivision thereof or (b)that are other connection taxes; (ii)in the case of a lender, any united states federal withholding taxes imposed on interest payable to or for the account of such lender pursuant to law in effect on the date on which such lender became a lender hereunder (except to the extent such taxes were not considered excluded taxes with respect to such lenders immediate assignor); (iii)taxes attributable to the recipients failure to comply with section2.14(e); and (iv)any united states withholding tax imposed under fatca in respect of payments hereunder or under the notes. if the borrower shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any note or any other documents to be delivered hereunder to any lender or the designated agent, (i)to the extent the tax is not an excluded tax, the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this section2.14) such lender or the designated agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii)the borrower shall make such deductions or withholdings and (iii)the borrower shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law. (b)in addition, the borrower shall pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or under the notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder or from the execution, delivery or registration of, performing under, or otherwise with respect to, this agreement or the notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder other than any taxes or other amounts imposed with respect to an assignment (other taxes). (c)the borrower shall indemnify each lender and the designated agent for and hold it harmless against the full amount of taxes (other than excluded taxes) or other taxes (including, without limitation, taxes of any kind imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this section2.14) imposed on or paid by such lender or the designated agent (as the case may be) as a result of payments hereunder and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. this indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such lender or the designated agent (as the case may be) provides to the borrower a certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability. (d)within 30 days after the date of any payment of taxes, the borrower shall furnish to the designated agent, at its address referred to in section9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment to the extent such a receipt is issued therefor, or other written proof  33 of payment thereof that is reasonably satisfactory to the designated agent. in the case of any payment hereunder or under the notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder by or on behalf of the borrower through an account or branch outside the united states or by or on behalf of the borrower by a payor that is not a united states person, if the borrower determines that no taxes are payable in respect thereof, the borrower shall furnish, or shall cause such payor to furnish, to the designated agent, at such address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to the designated agent stating that such payment is exempt from taxes. for purposes of this subsection (d)and subsection (e), the terms united states and united states person shall have the meanings specified in section7701 of the internal revenue code. (e)(i) each lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the united states, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this agreement in the case of each initial lender and on the date of the assumption agreement or the assignment and assumption pursuant to which it becomes a lender in the case of each other lender, and from time to time thereafter as reasonably requested in writing by the borrower (but only so long as such lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the designated agent and the borrower with two original internal revenue service formsw-8ben, w8ben-e, w-8imy or w-8eci, as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the internal revenue service, certifying that such lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of united states withholding tax on payments pursuant to this agreement or the notes. any lender claiming the benefits of the exemption of the portfolio interest under section871(h) or 881(c) of the internal revenue code shall provide each of the designated agent and the borrower, in addition to the forms w-8ben or w-8ben-e provided pursuant to the preceding sentence, a certificate, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the borrower, to the effect that such lender is not a bank within the meaning of section881(c)(3)(a) of the internal revenue code, a 10% shareholder within the meaning of sections 881(c)(3)(b) or 871(h)(3)(b) of the internal revenue code, or a controlled foreign corporation related to the borrower within the meaning of section881(c )(3)(c) of the internal revenue code. if the form provided by a lender at the time such lender first becomes a party to this agreement indicates a united states interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered an excluded tax unless and until such lender provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate shall be considered an excluded tax; provided, however, that, if at the date of the assumption agreement or the assignment and assumption pursuant to which a lender assignee becomes a party to this agreement, the lender assignor was entitled to payments under subsection(a) in respect of united states federal withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in taxes) united states federal withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the lender assignee on such date. (ii)if a payment made to a lender under any loan document would be subject to u.s. federal withholding tax imposed by fatca if such lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of fatca (including those contained in section1471(b) or 1472(b) of the internal revenue code, as applicable), such lender shall deliver to the borrower and the designated agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the borrower or the designated agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by section1471(b)(3)(c)(i) of the internal revenue code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the borrower or the designated agent as may be necessary for the borrower and the designated agent to comply with their obligations under fatca and to determine that such lender has complied with such lenders obligations under fatca or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. solely for purposes of this clause (ii), fatca shall include any amendments made to fatca after the date of this agreement.  34 (iii)each lender that is a united states person, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this agreement in the case of each initial lender and on the date of the assumption agreement or the assignment and assumption pursuant to which it becomes a lender in the case of each other lender, and from time to time thereafter as reasonably requested in writing by the borrower (but only so long as such lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the designated agent and the borrower with two original internal revenue service forms w-9, or any successor or other form prescribed by the internal revenue service, certifying that such lender is exempt from united states federal backup withholding tax. (iv)each lender agrees that if any form or certification previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the borrower and the designated agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. (f)for any period with respect to which a lender has failed to provide the borrower with the appropriate form, certificate or other document described in section2.14(e) (other than if such failure is due to a change in law, or in the interpretation or application thereof, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form, certificate or other document originally was required to be provided, or if such form, certificate or other document otherwise is not required under subsection(e) above), such lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under section2.14(a) or (c)with respect to taxes imposed by the united states by reason of such failure; provided, however, that should a lender become subject to taxes because of its failure to deliver a form, certificate or other document required hereunder, the borrower shall take such steps as the lender shall reasonably request to assist the lender to recover such taxes. (g)any lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this section2.14 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its eurodollar lending office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such lender. (h)any lender making a claim for compensation under this section2.14 may be required to assign all of its rights and obligations hereunder upon a request by the borrower in accordance with section2.21. (i)in the event a lender is entitled, on the effective date of an assumption agreement or assignment and assumption, to the benefits of a payment pursuant to this section2.14, an assignee or novatee of such lender shall be entitled to the same benefits of payment (in addition to any future benefits of payment that may arise with respect to such assignee) that would have been available to such lender had such lender not entered into the related assumption agreement or assignment and assumption with such assignee or novatee and then only to the extent the relevant amounts are incurred by such assignee or novatee. (j)if any lender or designated agent (for purposes of this paragraph (j), an indemnified party) determines, in its sole discretion (such discretion to be exercised in good faith), that it has received a refund of any taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this section2.14 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this section2.14), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this section with respect to the taxes giving rise to such refund). such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (j)(plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such governmental authority. this paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it reasonably deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other person.  35 (k)for purposes of determining withholding taxes imposed under fatca, from and after the effective date of this agreement, the borrower and the designated agent shall treat (and the lenders hereby authorize the designated agent to treat) this amendment and restatement of the existing credit agreement and the advances as not qualifying as a grandfathered obligation within the meaning of treasury regulation section1.1471-2(b)(2)(i). section 2.15. sharing of payments, etc. if any lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its advances or other obligations hereunder resulting in such lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its advances and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a)notify the designated agent of such fact, and (b)purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the advances and such other obligations of the other lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective advances and other amounts owing them; provided that: (i)if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and (ii)the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (x)any payment made by the borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a defaulting lender), or (y)any payment obtained by a lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its advances to any assignee or participant, other than to the borrower or any subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). each loan party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each loan party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such lender were a direct creditor of each loan party in the amount of such participation. section 2.16. evidence of debt. (a)each lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the borrower to such lender resulting from each advance owing to such lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such lender from time to time hereunder in respect of advances. the borrower agrees that upon notice by any lender to the borrower (with a copy of such notice to the designated agent) to the effect that a note is required or appropriate in order for such lender to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the advances owing to, or to be made by, such lender, the borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such lender a note payable to the order of such lender in a principal amount up to the revolving credit commitment of such lender. (b)the register maintained by the designated agent pursuant to section9.07(c) shall include a control account, and a subsidiary account for each lender, in which accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i)the date and amount of each borrowing made hereunder, the type of advances comprising such borrowing and, if appropriate, the interest period applicable thereto, (ii)the terms of each assumption agreement and each assignment and assumption delivered to and accepted by it, (iii)the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the borrower to each lender hereunder and (iv)the amount of any sum received by the designated agent from the borrower hereunder and each lenders share thereof.  36 (c)entries made in good faith by the designated agent in the register pursuant to subsection (b)above, and by each lender in its account or accounts pursuant to subsection (a)above, shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the borrower to, in the case of the register, each lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such lender, under this agreement, absent manifest error; provided, however, that the failure of the designated agent or such lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the borrower under this agreement. section 2.17. use of proceeds. the proceeds of the advances shall be available (and the borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds) solely for general corporate purposes of the borrower and its subsidiaries. section 2.18. increase in the aggregate revolving credit commitments. (a)the borrower may, at any time prior to the final termination date, by notice to the designated agent, request that the aggregate amount of the revolving credit commitment be increased by an amount of $25,000,000 or an integral multiple thereof (each a commitment increase) to be effective as of a date that is at least 90 days prior to the scheduled final termination date then in effect (the increase date) as specified in the related notice to the designated agent; provided, however that (i)in no event shall the aggregate amount of the revolving credit commitments at any time exceed $2,000,000,000 and (ii)on the date of any request by the borrower for a commitment increase and on the related increase date, the applicable conditions set forth in article iii shall be satisfied. the borrower may simultaneously (x)request one or more of the lenders to increase the amount of its commitment and/or (y)arrange for one or more banks or financial institutions not a party hereto to become parties to and lenders under this agreement, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth below.

(ii)if a payment made to a lender under any loan document would be subject to u.s. federal withholding tax imposed by fatca if such lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of fatca (including those contained in section1471(b) or 1472(b) of the internal revenue code, as applicable), such lender shall deliver to the borrower and the designated agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the borrower or the designated agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by section1471(b)(3)(c)(i) of the internal revenue code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the borrower or the designated agent as may be necessary for the borrower and the designated agent to comply with their obligations under fatca and to determine that such lender has complied with such lenders obligations under fatca or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. solely for purposes of this clause (ii), fatca shall include any amendments made to fatca after the date of this agreement.  34 (iii)each lender that is a united states person, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this agreement in the case of each initial lender and on the date of the assumption agreement or the assignment and assumption pursuant to which it becomes a lender in the case of each other lender, and from time to time thereafter as reasonably requested in writing by the borrower (but only so long as such lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the designated agent and the borrower with two original internal revenue service forms w-9, or any successor or other form prescribed by the internal revenue service, certifying that such lender is exempt from united states federal backup withholding tax. (iv)each lender agrees that if any form or certification previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the borrower and the designated agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. (f)for any period with respect to which a lender has failed to provide the borrower with the appropriate form, certificate or other document described in section2.14(e) (other than if such failure is due to a change in law, or in the interpretation or application thereof, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form, certificate or other document originally was required to be provided, or if such form, certificate or other document otherwise is not required under subsection(e) above), such lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under section2.14(a) or (c)with respect to taxes imposed by the united states by reason of such failure; provided, however, that should a lender become subject to taxes because of its failure to deliver a form, certificate or other document required hereunder, the borrower shall take such steps as the lender shall reasonably request to assist the lender to recover such taxes. (g)any lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this section2.14 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its eurodollar lending office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such lender. (h)any lender making a claim for compensation under this section2.14 may be required to assign all of its rights and obligations hereunder upon a request by the borrower in accordance with section2.21. (i)in the event a lender is entitled, on the effective date of an assumption agreement or assignment and assumption, to the benefits of a payment pursuant to this section2.14, an assignee or novatee of such lender shall be entitled to the same benefits of payment (in addition to any future benefits of payment that may arise with respect to such assignee) that would have been available to such lender had such lender not entered into the related assumption agreement or assignment and assumption with such assignee or novatee and then only to the extent the relevant amounts are incurred by such assignee or novatee. (j)if any lender or designated agent (for purposes of this paragraph (j), an indemnified party) determines, in its sole discretion (such discretion to be exercised in good faith), that it has received a refund of any taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this section2.14 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this section2.14), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this section with respect to the taxes giving rise to such refund). such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (j)(plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such governmental authority. this paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it reasonably deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other person.  35 (k)for purposes of determining withholding taxes imposed under fatca, from and after the effective date of this agreement, the borrower and the designated agent shall treat (and the lenders hereby authorize the designated agent to treat) this amendment and restatement of the existing credit agreement and the advances as not qualifying as a grandfathered obligation within the meaning of treasury regulation section1.1471-2(b)(2)(i). section 2.15. sharing of payments, etc. if any lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its advances or other obligations hereunder resulting in such lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its advances and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a)notify the designated agent of such fact, and (b)purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the advances and such other obligations of the other lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective advances and other amounts owing them; provided that: (i)if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and (ii)the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (x)any payment made by the borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a defaulting lender), or (y)any payment obtained by a lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its advances to any assignee or participant, other than to the borrower or any subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). each loan party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each loan party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such lender were a direct creditor of each loan party in the amount of such participation. section 2.16. evidence of debt. (a)each lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the borrower to such lender resulting from each advance owing to such lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such lender from time to time hereunder in respect of advances. the borrower agrees that upon notice by any lender to the borrower (with a copy of such notice to the designated agent) to the effect that a note is required or appropriate in order for such lender to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the advances owing to, or to be made by, such lender, the borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such lender a note payable to the order of such lender in a principal amount up to the revolving credit commitment of such lender. (b)the register maintained by the designated agent pursuant to section9.07(c) shall include a control account, and a subsidiary account for each lender, in which accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i)the date and amount of each borrowing made hereunder, the type of advances comprising such borrowing and, if appropriate, the interest period applicable thereto, (ii)the terms of each assumption agreement and each assignment and assumption delivered to and accepted by it, (iii)the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the borrower to each lender hereunder and (iv)the amount of any sum received by the designated agent from the borrower hereunder and each lenders share thereof.  36 (c)entries made in good faith by the designated agent in the register pursuant to subsection (b)above, and by each lender in its account or accounts pursuant to subsection (a)above, shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the borrower to, in the case of the register, each lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such lender, under this agreement, absent manifest error; provided, however, that the failure of the designated agent or such lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the borrower under this agreement. section 2.17. use of proceeds. the proceeds of the advances shall be available (and the borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds) solely for general corporate purposes of the borrower and its subsidiaries. section 2.18. increase in the aggregate revolving credit commitments.

(b)if all the lenders consent in writing to any such request in accordance with subsection (a)of this section2.19, the termination date in effect at such time shall, effective as at the applicable anniversary date (the extension date), be extended for one year; provided that on each extension date the applicable conditions set forth in article iii shall be satisfied. if less than all of the lenders consent in writing to any such request in accordance with subsection (a)of this section2.19, the  38 termination date in effect at such time shall, effective as at the applicable extension date and subject to subsection (d)of this section2.19, be extended as to those lenders that so consented (each a consenting lender) but shall not be extended as to any other lender (each a non-consenting lender). to the extent that the termination date is not extended as to any lender pursuant to this section2.19 and the revolving credit commitment of such lender is not assumed in accordance with subsection (c)of this section2.19 on or prior to the applicable extension date, the revolving credit commitment of such non-consenting lender shall automatically terminate in whole on such unextended termination date without any further notice or other action by the borrower, such lender or any other person; provided that such non-consenting lenders rights under sections 2.11, 2.14 and 9.04, and its obligations under section9.16, shall survive the termination date for such lender as to matters occurring prior to such date. it is understood and agreed that no lender shall have any obligation whatsoever to agree to any request made by the borrower for any requested extension of the termination date.

 40 (ii)if the reallocation described in clause (i)above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the borrower shall within two business days following notice by the designated agent, cash collateralize for the benefit of each issuing bank only the borrowers obligations corresponding to such defaulting lenders l/c exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i)above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in section6.02 for so long as such l/c exposure is outstanding or such lender remains a defaulting lender; (iii)if the borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such defaulting lenders l/c exposure pursuant to clause (ii)above, the borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such defaulting lender pursuant to section2.04(b) with respect to such defaulting lenders l/c exposure during the period such defaulting lenders l/c exposure is cash collateralized;

and (v)if all or any portion of such defaulting lenders l/c exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i)or (ii)above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any issuing bank or any other lender hereunder, all facility fees that otherwise would have been payable to such defaulting lender (solely with respect to the portion of such defaulting lenders revolving credit commitment that was utilized by such l/c exposure) and letter of credit commissions payable under section2.04(b) with respect to such defaulting lenders l/c exposure shall be payable to the applicable issuing banks until and to the extent that such l/c exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and (d)so long as such lender is a defaulting lender, no issuing bank shall be required to issue, amend or increase any letter of credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the defaulting lenders then outstanding l/c exposure will be 100% covered by the revolving credit commitments of the non-defaulting lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the borrower in accordance with section6.02, and participating interests in any newly issued or increased letter of credit shall be allocated among non-defaulting lenders in a manner consistent with section2.20(c)(i) (and such defaulting lender shall not participate therein). in the event that the designated agent, the borrower and the issuing banks each agrees that a defaulting lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such lender to be a defaulting lender, then the l/c exposure of the lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such lenders revolving credit commitment and on such date such lender shall purchase at par such of the advances of the other lenders as the designated agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such lender to hold such advances in accordance with its pro rata share. section 2.21.replacement of lenders or issuing banks.

(d)whenever any payment hereunder or under the notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a business day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding business day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or facility fee, as the case may be; provided, however, that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of eurodollar rate advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding business day. (e)unless the designated agent shall have received notice from the borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the lenders hereunder that the borrower will not make such payment in full, the designated agent may assume that the borrower has made such payment in full to the designated agent on such date and the designated agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such lender. if and to the extent the borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the designated agent, each lender shall repay to the designated agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such lender until the date such lender repays such amount to the designated agent, at the federal funds rate.  32 section 2.14. taxes. (a)any and all payments by the borrower to or for the account of any lender or the designated agent hereunder or under the notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder shall be made, in accordance with section2.13 or the applicable provisions of such other documents, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, deductions, charges or withholdings (including back-up withholding), assessments, fees or other charges imposed by any governmental authority, including any interest, additions to tax or penalties with respect thereto (taxes), unless otherwise required by applicable law. excluded taxes means in the case of each lender and the designated agent (i)taxes imposed on or measured by its net income (however denominated), franchise taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income taxes and branch profits taxes, in each case, (a)by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such lender or the designated agent (as the case may be) is organized or has its principal office or applicable lending office or any political subdivision thereof or (b)that are other connection taxes; (ii)in the case of a lender, any united states federal withholding taxes imposed on interest payable to or for the account of such lender pursuant to law in effect on the date on which such lender became a lender hereunder (except to the extent such taxes were not considered excluded taxes with respect to such lenders immediate assignor); (iii)taxes attributable to the recipients failure to comply with section2.14(e); and (iv)any united states withholding tax imposed under fatca in respect of payments hereunder or under the notes. if the borrower shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any note or any other documents to be delivered hereunder to any lender or the designated agent, (i)to the extent the tax is not an excluded tax, the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this section2.14) such lender or the designated agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii)the borrower shall make such deductions or withholdings and (iii)the borrower shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law. (b)in addition, the borrower shall pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or under the notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder or from the execution, delivery or registration of, performing under, or otherwise with respect to, this agreement or the notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder other than any taxes or other amounts imposed with respect to an assignment (other taxes). (c)the borrower shall indemnify each lender and the designated agent for and hold it harmless against the full amount of taxes (other than excluded taxes) or other taxes (including, without limitation, taxes of any kind imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this section2.14) imposed on or paid by such lender or the designated agent (as the case may be) as a result of payments hereunder and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. this indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such lender or the designated agent (as the case may be) provides to the borrower a certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability. (d)within 30 days after the date of any payment of taxes, the borrower shall furnish to the designated agent, at its address referred to in section9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment to the extent such a receipt is issued therefor, or other written proof  33 of payment thereof that is reasonably satisfactory to the designated agent. in the case of any payment hereunder or under the notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder by or on behalf of the borrower through an account or branch outside the united states or by or on behalf of the borrower by a payor that is not a united states person, if the borrower determines that no taxes are payable in respect thereof, the borrower shall furnish, or shall cause such payor to furnish, to the designated agent, at such address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to the designated agent stating that such payment is exempt from taxes. for purposes of this subsection (d)and subsection (e), the terms united states and united states person shall have the meanings specified in section7701 of the internal revenue code. (e)(i) each lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the united states, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this agreement in the case of each initial lender and on the date of the assumption agreement or the assignment and assumption pursuant to which it becomes a lender in the case of each other lender, and from time to time thereafter as reasonably requested in writing by the borrower (but only so long as such lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the designated agent and the borrower with two original internal revenue service formsw-8ben, w8ben-e, w-8imy or w-8eci, as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the internal revenue service, certifying that such lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of united states withholding tax on payments pursuant to this agreement or the notes. any lender claiming the benefits of the exemption of the portfolio interest under section871(h) or 881(c) of the internal revenue code shall provide each of the designated agent and the borrower, in addition to the forms w-8ben or w-8ben-e provided pursuant to the preceding sentence, a certificate, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the borrower, to the effect that such lender is not a bank within the meaning of section881(c)(3)(a) of the internal revenue code, a 10% shareholder within the meaning of sections 881(c)(3)(b) or 871(h)(3)(b) of the internal revenue code, or a controlled foreign corporation related to the borrower within the meaning of section881(c )(3)(c) of the internal revenue code. if the form provided by a lender at the time such lender first becomes a party to this agreement indicates a united states interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered an excluded tax unless and until such lender provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate shall be considered an excluded tax; provided, however, that, if at the date of the assumption agreement or the assignment and assumption pursuant to which a lender assignee becomes a party to this agreement, the lender assignor was entitled to payments under subsection(a) in respect of united states federal withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in taxes) united states federal withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the lender assignee on such date. (ii)if a payment made to a lender under any loan document would be subject to u.s. federal withholding tax imposed by fatca if such lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of fatca (including those contained in section1471(b) or 1472(b) of the internal revenue code, as applicable), such lender shall deliver to the borrower and the designated agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the borrower or the designated agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by section1471(b)(3)(c)(i) of the internal revenue code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the borrower or the designated agent as may be necessary for the borrower and the designated agent to comply with their obligations under fatca and to determine that such lender has complied with such lenders obligations under fatca or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. solely for purposes of this clause (ii), fatca shall include any amendments made to fatca after the date of this agreement.  34 (iii)each lender that is a united states person, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this agreement in the case of each initial lender and on the date of the assumption agreement or the assignment and assumption pursuant to which it becomes a lender in the case of each other lender, and from time to time thereafter as reasonably requested in writing by the borrower (but only so long as such lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the designated agent and the borrower with two original internal revenue service forms w-9, or any successor or other form prescribed by the internal revenue service, certifying that such lender is exempt from united states federal backup withholding tax. (iv)each lender agrees that if any form or certification previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the borrower and the designated agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. (f)for any period with respect to which a lender has failed to provide the borrower with the appropriate form, certificate or other document described in section2.14(e) (other than if such failure is due to a change in law, or in the interpretation or application thereof, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form, certificate or other document originally was required to be provided, or if such form, certificate or other document otherwise is not required under subsection(e) above), such lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under section2.14(a) or (c)with respect to taxes imposed by the united states by reason of such failure; provided, however, that should a lender become subject to taxes because of its failure to deliver a form, certificate or other document required hereunder, the borrower shall take such steps as the lender shall reasonably request to assist the lender to recover such taxes. (g)any lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this section2.14 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its eurodollar lending office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such lender. (h)any lender making a claim for compensation under this section2.14 may be required to assign all of its rights and obligations hereunder upon a request by the borrower in accordance with section2.21. (i)in the event a lender is entitled, on the effective date of an assumption agreement or assignment and assumption, to the benefits of a payment pursuant to this section2.14, an assignee or novatee of such lender shall be entitled to the same benefits of payment (in addition to any future benefits of payment that may arise with respect to such assignee) that would have been available to such lender had such lender not entered into the related assumption agreement or assignment and assumption with such assignee or novatee and then only to the extent the relevant amounts are incurred by such assignee or novatee. (j)if any lender or designated agent (for purposes of this paragraph (j), an indemnified party) determines, in its sole discretion (such discretion to be exercised in good faith), that it has received a refund of any taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this section2.14 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this section2.14), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this section with respect to the taxes giving rise to such refund). such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (j)(plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such governmental authority. this paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it reasonably deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other person.  35 (k)for purposes of determining withholding taxes imposed under fatca, from and after the effective date of this agreement, the borrower and the designated agent shall treat (and the lenders hereby authorize the designated agent to treat) this amendment and restatement of the existing credit agreement and the advances as not qualifying as a grandfathered obligation within the meaning of treasury regulation section1.1471-2(b)(2)(i). section 2.15. sharing of payments, etc. if any lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its advances or other obligations hereunder resulting in such lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its advances and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a)notify the designated agent of such fact, and (b)purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the advances and such other obligations of the other lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective advances and other amounts owing them; provided that: (i)if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and (ii)the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (x)any payment made by the borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a defaulting lender), or (y)any payment obtained by a lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its advances to any assignee or participant, other than to the borrower or any subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). each loan party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each loan party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such lender were a direct creditor of each loan party in the amount of such participation. section 2.16. evidence of debt. (a)each lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the borrower to such lender resulting from each advance owing to such lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such lender from time to time hereunder in respect of advances. the borrower agrees that upon notice by any lender to the borrower (with a copy of such notice to the designated agent) to the effect that a note is required or appropriate in order for such lender to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the advances owing to, or to be made by, such lender, the borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such lender a note payable to the order of such lender in a principal amount up to the revolving credit commitment of such lender. (b)the register maintained by the designated agent pursuant to section9.07(c) shall include a control account, and a subsidiary account for each lender, in which accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i)the date and amount of each borrowing made hereunder, the type of advances comprising such borrowing and, if appropriate, the interest period applicable thereto, (ii)the terms of each assumption agreement and each assignment and assumption delivered to and accepted by it, (iii)the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the borrower to each lender hereunder and (iv)the amount of any sum received by the designated agent from the borrower hereunder and each lenders share thereof.  36 (c)entries made in good faith by the designated agent in the register pursuant to subsection (b)above, and by each lender in its account or accounts pursuant to subsection (a)above, shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the borrower to, in the case of the register, each lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such lender, under this agreement, absent manifest error; provided, however, that the failure of the designated agent or such lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the borrower under this agreement. section 2.17. use of proceeds. the proceeds of the advances shall be available (and the borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds) solely for general corporate purposes of the borrower and its subsidiaries. section 2.18. increase in the aggregate revolving credit commitments. (a)the borrower may, at any time prior to the final termination date, by notice to the designated agent, request that the aggregate amount of the revolving credit commitment be increased by an amount of $25,000,000 or an integral multiple thereof (each a commitment increase) to be effective as of a date that is at least 90 days prior to the scheduled final termination date then in effect (the increase date) as specified in the related notice to the designated agent; provided, however that (i)in no event shall the aggregate amount of the revolving credit commitments at any time exceed $2,000,000,000 and (ii)on the date of any request by the borrower for a commitment increase and on the related increase date, the applicable conditions set forth in article iii shall be satisfied. the borrower may simultaneously (x)request one or more of the lenders to increase the amount of its commitment and/or (y)arrange for one or more banks or financial institutions not a party hereto to become parties to and lenders under this agreement, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth below. (b)the designated agent shall promptly notify such of the lenders and one or more eligible assignees as are identified by the borrower to receive the invitation to participate in the requested commitment increase of a request by the borrower for a commitment increase, which notice shall include (i)the proposed amount of such requested commitment increase, (ii)the proposed increase date and (iii)the date by which such lenders or eligible assignees (each such eligible assignee and each eligible assignee that agrees to an extension of the termination date in accordance with section2.19(c), an assuming lender) wishing to participate in the commitment increase must commit to increase the amount of their respective revolving credit commitments or to establish their respective revolving credit commitments, as the case may be (the commitment date); provided, however, that the revolving credit commitment of each such eligible assignee shall be in an amount of $5,000,000 or more. each lender that is willing to participate in such requested commitment increase (each an increasing lender) shall, in its sole discretion, give written notice to the designated agent on or prior to the commitment date of the amount by which it is willing to increase its revolving credit commitment. each increase in the revolving credit commitments of the increasing lenders and the revolving credit commitment of each assuming lender shall be subject to the approval of each issuing bank (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). the requested commitment increase shall be allocated among the lenders willing to participate therein and the assuming lenders in such amounts as are agreed between the borrower and the designated agent.  37 (c)on each increase date, each assuming lender shall become a lender party to this agreement as of such increase date and the revolving credit commitment of each increasing lender for such requested commitment increase shall be so increased by such amount (or by the amount allocated to such lender pursuant to the last sentence of section2.18(b)) as of such increase date; provided, however, that the designated agent shall have received on or before such increase date the following, each dated such date: (i)(a) certified copies of resolutions of the board of directors of the borrower or the executive committee of such board of directors approving the commitment increase and the corresponding modifications to this agreement, (b)if reasonably requested by the designated agent, an opinion of counsel for the borrower (which may be in-house counsel), and (c)a consent of the parent guarantor; (ii)an assumption agreement from each assuming lender, if any, in form and substance satisfactory to the borrower and the designated agent (each an assumption agreement), duly executed by such eligible assignee, the designated agent and the borrower; and (iii)confirmation from each increasing lender of the increase in the amount of its revolving credit commitment in a writing satisfactory to the borrower and the designated agent. on each increase date, upon fulfillment of the conditions set forth in section2.18(a) and in the immediately preceding sentence of this section2.18(c), the designated agent shall notify the lenders (including, without limitation, each assuming lender) and the borrower of the occurrence of the commitment increase to be effected on such increase date and shall record in the register the relevant information with respect to each increasing lender and each assuming lender on such date. if any advances are outstanding on the increase date, the lenders immediately after effectiveness of such commitment increase shall purchase and assign at par such amounts of the advances outstanding at such time as the designated agent may require such that each lender holds its pro rata share of all advances outstanding after giving effect to all such assignments. on and after each increase date, the pro rata share of each lenders participation in letters of credit and advances from draws under letters of credit shall be calculated after giving effect to each such commitment increase. section 2.19. extension of termination date. (a)at least 45 days but not more than 90 days prior to any anniversary of the effective date, the borrower, by written notice to the designated agent, may request an extension of the termination date in effect at such time by one year from its then scheduled expiration; provided the final termination date may not extend more than two years from the initial termination date. the designated agent shall promptly notify each lender of such request, and each lender shall in turn, in its sole discretion, not later than 20 days prior to such anniversary date, notify the borrower and the designated agent in writing as to whether such lender will consent to such extension. if any lender shall fail to notify the designated agent and the borrower in writing of its consent to any such request for extension of the termination date at least 20 days prior to the applicable anniversary date, such lender shall be deemed to be a non-consenting lender with respect to such request. the designated agent shall notify the borrower not later than 15 days prior to the applicable anniversary date of the decision of the lenders regarding the borrowers request for an extension of the termination date. (b)if all the lenders consent in writing to any such request in accordance with subsection (a)of this section2.19, the termination date in effect at such time shall, effective as at the applicable anniversary date (the extension date), be extended for one year; provided that on each extension date the applicable conditions set forth in article iii shall be satisfied. if less than all of the lenders consent in writing to any such request in accordance with subsection (a)of this section2.19, the  38 termination date in effect at such time shall, effective as at the applicable extension date and subject to subsection (d)of this section2.19, be extended as to those lenders that so consented (each a consenting lender) but shall not be extended as to any other lender (each a non-consenting lender). to the extent that the termination date is not extended as to any lender pursuant to this section2.19 and the revolving credit commitment of such lender is not assumed in accordance with subsection (c)of this section2.19 on or prior to the applicable extension date, the revolving credit commitment of such non-consenting lender shall automatically terminate in whole on such unextended termination date without any further notice or other action by the borrower, such lender or any other person; provided that such non-consenting lenders rights under sections 2.11, 2.14 and 9.04, and its obligations under section9.16, shall survive the termination date for such lender as to matters occurring prior to such date. it is understood and agreed that no lender shall have any obligation whatsoever to agree to any request made by the borrower for any requested extension of the termination date. (c)if less than all of the lenders consent to any such request pursuant to subsection (a)of this section2.19, the designated agent shall promptly so notify the borrower. the borrower may arrange for one or more consenting lenders or other eligible assignees as assuming lenders to assume, pursuant to assignments and assumptions, effective as of the extension date, any non-consenting lenders revolving credit commitment and all of the obligations of such non-consenting lender under this agreement thereafter arising, without recourse to or warranty by, or expense to, such non-consenting lender (with such revolving credit commitment to replace the revolving credit commitment of any non-consenting lender as designated by the borrower); provided, however, that (x)the amount of the revolving credit commitment of any such assuming lender as a result of such substitution shall in no event be less than $5,000,000 unless the amount of the commitment of such non-consenting lender is less than $5,000,000, in which case such assuming lender shall assume all of such lesser amount and (y)each increase in the revolving credit commitment of the consenting lenders shall be approved by each issuing bank (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and provided further that: (i)any such consenting lender or assuming lender shall have paid to such non-consenting lender (a)the aggregate principal amount of, and any interest accrued and unpaid to the effective date of the assignment on, the outstanding advances, if any, of such non-consenting lender plus (b)any accrued but unpaid facility fees owing to such non-consenting lender as of the effective date of such assignment; (ii)all additional costs, reimbursements, expense reimbursements and indemnities payable to such non-consenting lender, and all other accrued and unpaid amounts owing to such non-consenting lender hereunder, as of the effective date of such assignment shall have been paid to such non-consenting lender; and (iii)with respect to any such assuming lender, the applicable processing and recordation fee required under section9.07(a) for such assignment shall have been paid; provided further that such non-consenting lenders rights under sections 2.11, 2.14 and 9.04, and its obligations under section9.16, shall survive such substitution as to matters occurring prior to the date of substitution. at least three business days prior to any extension date, (a)each such assuming lender, if any, shall have delivered to the borrower and the designated agent an assumption agreement, duly executed by such assuming lender, such non-consenting lender, the borrower and the designated agent, (b)any such consenting lender shall have delivered confirmation in writing satisfactory to the borrower and the designated agent as to the increase in the amount of its revolving credit commitment and (c)each non-consenting lender being replaced pursuant to this section2.19 shall have delivered to the designated agent any note or notes held by such non-consenting lender. upon the payment or  39 prepayment of all amounts referred to in clauses (i), (ii)and (iii)of the immediately preceding sentence, each such consenting lender or assuming lender, as of the extension date, will be substituted for such non-consenting lender under this agreement and shall be a lender for all purposes of this agreement, without any further acknowledgment by or the consent of the other lenders, and the obligations of each such non-consenting lender hereunder (other than its obligations under section9.16 as to matters occurring prior to such date) shall, by the provisions hereof, be released and discharged. (d)if (after giving effect to any assignments or assumptions pursuant to subsection (c)of this section2.19) lenders having commitments equal to at least 50% of the revolving credit commitments in effect immediately prior to the extension date consent in writing to a requested extension (whether by execution or delivery of an assumption agreement or otherwise) not later than one business day prior to such extension date, the designated agent shall so notify the borrower, and, subject to the satisfaction of the applicable conditions in article iii, the termination date then in effect for each such lender shall be extended for the additional one-year period as described in subsection (a)of this section2.19, and all references in this agreement, and in the notes, if any, to the termination date shall, with respect to each consenting lender and each assuming lender for such extension date, refer to the termination date as so extended. promptly following each extension date, the designated agent shall notify the lenders (including, without limitation, each assuming lender) of the extension of the scheduled termination date in effect immediately prior thereto and shall thereupon record in the register the relevant information with respect to each such consenting lender and each such assuming lender.

(b)the revolving credit commitment and advances of such defaulting lender shall not be included in determining whether the required lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to section9.01); provided, that this clause (b)shall not apply to the vote of a defaulting lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of each lender affected thereby; (c)if any l/c exposure exists at the time such lender becomes a defaulting lender then: (i)all or any part of l/c exposure of such defaulting lender shall be reallocated among the non-defaulting lenders in accordance with their respective pro rata shares but only to the extent that (x)the sum of the aggregate principal amount of advances owing to all non-defaulting lenders plus the aggregate amount of l/c exposure of all lenders does not exceed the total of all non-defaulting lenders revolving credit commitments, (y)after giving effect to such reallocation, the sum of the aggregate principal amount of advances owing to, and the l/c exposure allocated to, each non-defaulting lender shall not exceed such non-defaulting lenders revolving credit commitment and (z)no event of default has occurred and is continuing;  40 (ii)if the reallocation described in clause (i)above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the borrower shall within two business days following notice by the designated agent, cash collateralize for the benefit of each issuing bank only the borrowers obligations corresponding to such defaulting lenders l/c exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i)above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in section6.02 for so long as such l/c exposure is outstanding or such lender remains a defaulting lender; (iii)if the borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such defaulting lenders l/c exposure pursuant to clause (ii)above, the borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such defaulting lender pursuant to section2.04(b) with respect to such defaulting lenders l/c exposure during the period such defaulting lenders l/c exposure is cash collateralized; (iv)if the l/c exposure of the non-defaulting lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i)above, then the fees payable to the lenders pursuant to section2.04(a) and section2.04(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-defaulting lenders pro rata shares;

(d)within 30 days after the date of any payment of taxes, the borrower shall furnish to the designated agent, at its address referred to in section9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment to the extent such a receipt is issued therefor, or other written proof  33 of payment thereof that is reasonably satisfactory to the designated agent. in the case of any payment hereunder or under the notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder by or on behalf of the borrower through an account or branch outside the united states or by or on behalf of the borrower by a payor that is not a united states person, if the borrower determines that no taxes are payable in respect thereof, the borrower shall furnish, or shall cause such payor to furnish, to the designated agent, at such address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to the designated agent stating that such payment is exempt from taxes. for purposes of this subsection (d)and subsection (e), the terms united states and united states person shall have the meanings specified in section7701 of the internal revenue code. (e)(i) each lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the united states, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this agreement in the case of each initial lender and on the date of the assumption agreement or the assignment and assumption pursuant to which it becomes a lender in the case of each other lender, and from time to time thereafter as reasonably requested in writing by the borrower (but only so long as such lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the designated agent and the borrower with two original internal revenue service formsw-8ben, w8ben-e, w-8imy or w-8eci, as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the internal revenue service, certifying that such lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of united states withholding tax on payments pursuant to this agreement or the notes. any lender claiming the benefits of the exemption of the portfolio interest under section871(h) or 881(c) of the internal revenue code shall provide each of the designated agent and the borrower, in addition to the forms w-8ben or w-8ben-e provided pursuant to the preceding sentence, a certificate, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the borrower, to the effect that such lender is not a bank within the meaning of section881(c)(3)(a) of the internal revenue code, a 10% shareholder within the meaning of sections 881(c)(3)(b) or 871(h)(3)(b) of the internal revenue code, or a controlled foreign corporation related to the borrower within the meaning of section881(c )(3)(c) of the internal revenue code. if the form provided by a lender at the time such lender first becomes a party to this agreement indicates a united states interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered an excluded tax unless and until such lender provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate shall be considered an excluded tax; provided, however, that, if at the date of the assumption agreement or the assignment and assumption pursuant to which a lender assignee becomes a party to this agreement, the lender assignor was entitled to payments under subsection(a) in respect of united states federal withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in taxes) united states federal withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the lender assignee on such date. (ii)if a payment made to a lender under any loan document would be subject to u.s. federal withholding tax imposed by fatca if such lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of fatca (including those contained in section1471(b) or 1472(b) of the internal revenue code, as applicable), such lender shall deliver to the borrower and the designated agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the borrower or the designated agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by section1471(b)(3)(c)(i) of the internal revenue code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the borrower or the designated agent as may be necessary for the borrower and the designated agent to comply with their obligations under fatca and to determine that such lender has complied with such lenders obligations under fatca or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. solely for purposes of this clause (ii), fatca shall include any amendments made to fatca after the date of this agreement.  34 (iii)each lender that is a united states person, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this agreement in the case of each initial lender and on the date of the assumption agreement or the assignment and assumption pursuant to which it becomes a lender in the case of each other lender, and from time to time thereafter as reasonably requested in writing by the borrower (but only so long as such lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the designated agent and the borrower with two original internal revenue service forms w-9, or any successor or other form prescribed by the internal revenue service, certifying that such lender is exempt from united states federal backup withholding tax. (iv)each lender agrees that if any form or certification previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the borrower and the designated agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. (f)for any period with respect to which a lender has failed to provide the borrower with the appropriate form, certificate or other document described in section2.14(e) (other than if such failure is due to a change in law, or in the interpretation or application thereof, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form, certificate or other document originally was required to be provided, or if such form, certificate or other document otherwise is not required under subsection(e) above), such lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under section2.14(a) or (c)with respect to taxes imposed by the united states by reason of such failure; provided, however, that should a lender become subject to taxes because of its failure to deliver a form, certificate or other document required hereunder, the borrower shall take such steps as the lender shall reasonably request to assist the lender to recover such taxes. (g)any lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this section2.14 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its eurodollar lending office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such lender. (h)any lender making a claim for compensation under this section2.14 may be required to assign all of its rights and obligations hereunder upon a request by the borrower in accordance with section2.21. (i)in the event a lender is entitled, on the effective date of an assumption agreement or assignment and assumption, to the benefits of a payment pursuant to this section2.14, an assignee or novatee of such lender shall be entitled to the same benefits of payment (in addition to any future benefits of payment that may arise with respect to such assignee) that would have been available to such lender had such lender not entered into the related assumption agreement or assignment and assumption with such assignee or novatee and then only to the extent the relevant amounts are incurred by such assignee or novatee. (j)if any lender or designated agent (for purposes of this paragraph (j), an indemnified party) determines, in its sole discretion (such discretion to be exercised in good faith), that it has received a refund of any taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this section2.14 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this section2.14), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this section with respect to the taxes giving rise to such refund). such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (j)(plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such governmental authority. this paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it reasonably deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other person.  35 (k)for purposes of determining withholding taxes imposed under fatca, from and after the effective date of this agreement, the borrower and the designated agent shall treat (and the lenders hereby authorize the designated agent to treat) this amendment and restatement of the existing credit agreement and the advances as not qualifying as a grandfathered obligation within the meaning of treasury regulation section1.1471-2(b)(2)(i). section 2.15. sharing of payments, etc. if any lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its advances or other obligations hereunder resulting in such lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its advances and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a)notify the designated agent of such fact, and (b)purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the advances and such other obligations of the other lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective advances and other amounts owing them; provided that: (i)if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and (ii)the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (x)any payment made by the borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a defaulting lender), or (y)any payment obtained by a lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its advances to any assignee or participant, other than to the borrower or any subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). each loan party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each loan party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such lender were a direct creditor of each loan party in the amount of such participation. section 2.16. evidence of debt. (a)each lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the borrower to such lender resulting from each advance owing to such lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such lender from time to time hereunder in respect of advances. the borrower agrees that upon notice by any lender to the borrower (with a copy of such notice to the designated agent) to the effect that a note is required or appropriate in order for such lender to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the advances owing to, or to be made by, such lender, the borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such lender a note payable to the order of such lender in a principal amount up to the revolving credit commitment of such lender. (b)the register maintained by the designated agent pursuant to section9.07(c) shall include a control account, and a subsidiary account for each lender, in which accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i)the date and amount of each borrowing made hereunder, the type of advances comprising such borrowing and, if appropriate, the interest period applicable thereto, (ii)the terms of each assumption agreement and each assignment and assumption delivered to and accepted by it, (iii)the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the borrower to each lender hereunder and (iv)the amount of any sum received by the designated agent from the borrower hereunder and each lenders share thereof.  36 (c)entries made in good faith by the designated agent in the register pursuant to subsection (b)above, and by each lender in its account or accounts pursuant to subsection (a)above, shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the borrower to, in the case of the register, each lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such lender, under this agreement, absent manifest error; provided, however, that the failure of the designated agent or such lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the borrower under this agreement. section 2.17. use of proceeds. the proceeds of the advances shall be available (and the borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds) solely for general corporate purposes of the borrower and its subsidiaries. section 2.18. increase in the aggregate revolving credit commitments.

(b)if all the lenders consent in writing to any such request in accordance with subsection (a)of this section2.19, the termination date in effect at such time shall, effective as at the applicable anniversary date (the extension date), be extended for one year; provided that on each extension date the applicable conditions set forth in article iii shall be satisfied. if less than all of the lenders consent in writing to any such request in accordance with subsection (a)of this section2.19, the  38 termination date in effect at such time shall, effective as at the applicable extension date and subject to subsection (d)of this section2.19, be extended as to those lenders that so consented (each a consenting lender) but shall not be extended as to any other lender (each a non-consenting lender). to the extent that the termination date is not extended as to any lender pursuant to this section2.19 and the revolving credit commitment of such lender is not assumed in accordance with subsection (c)of this section2.19 on or prior to the applicable extension date, the revolving credit commitment of such non-consenting lender shall automatically terminate in whole on such unextended termination date without any further notice or other action by the borrower, such lender or any other person; provided that such non-consenting lenders rights under sections 2.11, 2.14 and 9.04, and its obligations under section9.16, shall survive the termination date for such lender as to matters occurring prior to such date. it is understood and agreed that no lender shall have any obligation whatsoever to agree to any request made by the borrower for any requested extension of the termination date.

 40 (ii)if the reallocation described in clause (i)above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the borrower shall within two business days following notice by the designated agent, cash collateralize for the benefit of each issuing bank only the borrowers obligations corresponding to such defaulting lenders l/c exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i)above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in section6.02 for so long as such l/c exposure is outstanding or such lender remains a defaulting lender; (iii)if the borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such defaulting lenders l/c exposure pursuant to clause (ii)above, the borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such defaulting lender pursuant to section2.04(b) with respect to such defaulting lenders l/c exposure during the period such defaulting lenders l/c exposure is cash collateralized;

and (v)if all or any portion of such defaulting lenders l/c exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i)or (ii)above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any issuing bank or any other lender hereunder, all facility fees that otherwise would have been payable to such defaulting lender (solely with respect to the portion of such defaulting lenders revolving credit commitment that was utilized by such l/c exposure) and letter of credit commissions payable under section2.04(b) with respect to such defaulting lenders l/c exposure shall be payable to the applicable issuing banks until and to the extent that such l/c exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and (d)so long as such lender is a defaulting lender, no issuing bank shall be required to issue, amend or increase any letter of credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the defaulting lenders then outstanding l/c exposure will be 100% covered by the revolving credit commitments of the non-defaulting lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the borrower in accordance with section6.02, and participating interests in any newly issued or increased letter of credit shall be allocated among non-defaulting lenders in a manner consistent with section2.20(c)(i) (and such defaulting lender shall not participate therein). in the event that the designated agent, the borrower and the issuing banks each agrees that a defaulting lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such lender to be a defaulting lender, then the l/c exposure of the lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such lenders revolving credit commitment and on such date such lender shall purchase at par such of the advances of the other lenders as the designated agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such lender to hold such advances in accordance with its pro rata share. section 2.21.replacement of lenders or issuing banks.

(a)if, due to either (i)the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law, rule, regulation or treaty or (ii)the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to any lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining eurodollar rate advances or agreeing to issue or of issuing or maintaining or participating in letters of credit (excluding for purposes of this section2.11 any such increased costs resulting from (i)taxes or other taxes (as to which section2.14 shall govern) or clauses (ii)-(iv)of the definition of excluded taxes and (ii)changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the united states or by the foreign jurisdiction or state under the laws of which such lender is organized or has its applicable lending office or any political subdivision thereof), then the borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by such lender (with a copy of such demand to the designated agent), pay to the designated agent for the account of such lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such lender for such increased cost; provided, however, that (i)before making any such demand, each lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different applicable lending office if the making of such a designation would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such increased cost and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such lender and (ii)such lender shall, in making demand under this section, certify that such lender is treating substantially all similarly situated borrowers in a manner that is consistent with the treatment afforded the borrower hereunder. a certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the borrower and the designated agent by such lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.  30 (b)if any lender determines that compliance with any law, rule, regulation or treaty or any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or would affect the amount of capital or liquidity required or expected to be maintained by such lender or any corporation controlling such lender and that the amount of such capital or liquidity is increased by or based upon the existence of such lenders commitment to lend or to issue or participate in letters of credit hereunder and other commitments of such type or the issuance or maintenance of or participation in the letters of credit (or similar contingent obligations), then, upon demand by such lender (with a copy of such demand to the designated agent), the borrower shall pay to the designated agent for the account of such lender, from time to time as specified by such lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such lender or such corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such lender reasonably determines such increase in capital or liquidity to be allocable to the existence of such lenders commitment to lend or to issue or participate in letters of credit hereunder or to the issuance or maintenance of or participation in any letters of credit; provided, however, that before making any such demand, each lender shall, in making demand under this section, certify that such lender is treating substantially all similarly situated borrowers in a manner that is consistent with the treatment afforded the borrower hereunder. a certificate as to such amounts submitted to the borrower and the designated agent by such lender shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (c)failure or delay on the part of any lender to demand compensation pursuant to this section shall not constitute a waiver of such lenders right to demand such compensation; provided that the borrower shall not be required to compensate a lender pursuant to this section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than six months prior to the date that such lender notifies the borrower of the change or circumstance giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such lenders intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the change or circumstance giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. any lender making a claim for compensation under this section2.11 may be required to assign all of its rights and obligations hereunder upon a request by the borrower in accordance with section2.21. (d)for the avoidance of doubt, this section2.11 shall apply to all requests, rules, guidelines or directives concerning capital adequacy or liquidity issued in connection with the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives concerning capital adequacy or liquidity promulgated by the bank for international settlements, the basel committee on banking supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the united states financial regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to basel iii, in each case, regardless of the date adopted, issued, promulgated or implemented. section 2.12. illegality. notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, if any lender shall notify the designated agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law, rule, regulation or treaty makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for any lender or its eurodollar lending office to perform its obligations hereunder to make eurodollar rate advances or to fund or maintain eurodollar rate advances hereunder, (a)each eurodollar rate advance will automatically, upon such demand, convert into a base rate advance, and (b)the obligation of the lenders to make eurodollar rate advances or to convert advances into eurodollar rate advances shall be suspended until the designated agent shall notify the borrower and the lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist; provided, however, that before making any such demand, each lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different eurodollar lending office if the making of such a designation would allow such lender or its eurodollar lending office to continue to perform its obligations to make eurodollar rate advances or to continue to fund or maintain eurodollar rate advances and would not, in the judgment of such lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such lender. any lender that is prohibited from performing its obligations to make eurodollar rate advances or to continue to fund or maintain eurodollar rate advances may be required to assign all of its rights and obligations hereunder upon a request by the borrower in accordance with section2.21.  31 section 2.13. payments and computations. (a)the borrower shall make each payment hereunder, irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off, not later than 11:00 a.m. (new york city time) on the day when due in dollars to the designated agent at the designated agents account in same day funds. the designated agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest, fees or commissions ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to section2.11, 2.14 or 9.04(d)) to the lenders for the account of their respective applicable lending offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any lender to such lender for the account of its applicable lending office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this agreement. upon any assuming lender becoming a lender hereunder as a result of a commitment increase pursuant to section2.18 or an extension of the termination date pursuant to section2.19, and upon the designated agents receipt of such lenders assumption agreement and recording of the information contained therein in the register, from and after the applicable increase date or extension date, as the case may be, the designated agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any notes issued in connection therewith in respect of the interest assumed thereby to the assuming lender. upon its acceptance of an assignment and assumption and recording of the information contained therein in the register pursuant to section9.07(c), from and after the effective date specified in such assignment and assumption, the designated agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such assignment and assumption shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves. (b)the borrower hereby authorizes each lender, if and to the extent payment owed to such lender is not made when due hereunder or under the note held by such lender, to charge from time to time against any or all of the borrowers accounts with such lender any amount so due to the fullest extent permitted by law. (c)all computations of interest based on the base rate shall be made by the designated agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the eurodollar rate or the federal funds rate and of fees and letter of credit commissions shall be made by the designated agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest, fees or commissions are payable. each determination by the designated agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (d)whenever any payment hereunder or under the notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a business day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding business day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or facility fee, as the case may be; provided, however, that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of eurodollar rate advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding business day. (e)unless the designated agent shall have received notice from the borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the lenders hereunder that the borrower will not make such payment in full, the designated agent may assume that the borrower has made such payment in full to the designated agent on such date and the designated agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such lender. if and to the extent the borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the designated agent, each lender shall repay to the designated agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such lender until the date such lender repays such amount to the designated agent, at the federal funds rate.  32 section 2.14. taxes. (a)any and all payments by the borrower to or for the account of any lender or the designated agent hereunder or under the notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder shall be made, in accordance with section2.13 or the applicable provisions of such other documents, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, deductions, charges or withholdings (including back-up withholding), assessments, fees or other charges imposed by any governmental authority, including any interest, additions to tax or penalties with respect thereto (taxes), unless otherwise required by applicable law. excluded taxes means in the case of each lender and the designated agent (i)taxes imposed on or measured by its net income (however denominated), franchise taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income taxes and branch profits taxes, in each case, (a)by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such lender or the designated agent (as the case may be) is organized or has its principal office or applicable lending office or any political subdivision thereof or (b)that are other connection taxes; (ii)in the case of a lender, any united states federal withholding taxes imposed on interest payable to or for the account of such lender pursuant to law in effect on the date on which such lender became a lender hereunder (except to the extent such taxes were not considered excluded taxes with respect to such lenders immediate assignor); (iii)taxes attributable to the recipients failure to comply with section2.14(e); and (iv)any united states withholding tax imposed under fatca in respect of payments hereunder or under the notes. if the borrower shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any note or any other documents to be delivered hereunder to any lender or the designated agent, (i)to the extent the tax is not an excluded tax, the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this section2.14) such lender or the designated agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii)the borrower shall make such deductions or withholdings and (iii)the borrower shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law. (b)in addition, the borrower shall pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or under the notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder or from the execution, delivery or registration of, performing under, or otherwise with respect to, this agreement or the notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder other than any taxes or other amounts imposed with respect to an assignment (other taxes). (c)the borrower shall indemnify each lender and the designated agent for and hold it harmless against the full amount of taxes (other than excluded taxes) or other taxes (including, without limitation, taxes of any kind imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this section2.14) imposed on or paid by such lender or the designated agent (as the case may be) as a result of payments hereunder and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. this indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such lender or the designated agent (as the case may be) provides to the borrower a certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability. (d)within 30 days after the date of any payment of taxes, the borrower shall furnish to the designated agent, at its address referred to in section9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment to the extent such a receipt is issued therefor, or other written proof  33 of payment thereof that is reasonably satisfactory to the designated agent. in the case of any payment hereunder or under the notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder by or on behalf of the borrower through an account or branch outside the united states or by or on behalf of the borrower by a payor that is not a united states person, if the borrower determines that no taxes are payable in respect thereof, the borrower shall furnish, or shall cause such payor to furnish, to the designated agent, at such address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to the designated agent stating that such payment is exempt from taxes. for purposes of this subsection (d)and subsection (e), the terms united states and united states person shall have the meanings specified in section7701 of the internal revenue code. (e)(i) each lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the united states, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this agreement in the case of each initial lender and on the date of the assumption agreement or the assignment and assumption pursuant to which it becomes a lender in the case of each other lender, and from time to time thereafter as reasonably requested in writing by the borrower (but only so long as such lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the designated agent and the borrower with two original internal revenue service formsw-8ben, w8ben-e, w-8imy or w-8eci, as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the internal revenue service, certifying that such lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of united states withholding tax on payments pursuant to this agreement or the notes. any lender claiming the benefits of the exemption of the portfolio interest under section871(h) or 881(c) of the internal revenue code shall provide each of the designated agent and the borrower, in addition to the forms w-8ben or w-8ben-e provided pursuant to the preceding sentence, a certificate, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the borrower, to the effect that such lender is not a bank within the meaning of section881(c)(3)(a) of the internal revenue code, a 10% shareholder within the meaning of sections 881(c)(3)(b) or 871(h)(3)(b) of the internal revenue code, or a controlled foreign corporation related to the borrower within the meaning of section881(c )(3)(c) of the internal revenue code. if the form provided by a lender at the time such lender first becomes a party to this agreement indicates a united states interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered an excluded tax unless and until such lender provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate shall be considered an excluded tax; provided, however, that, if at the date of the assumption agreement or the assignment and assumption pursuant to which a lender assignee becomes a party to this agreement, the lender assignor was entitled to payments under subsection(a) in respect of united states federal withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in taxes) united states federal withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the lender assignee on such date. (ii)if a payment made to a lender under any loan document would be subject to u.s. federal withholding tax imposed by fatca if such lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of fatca (including those contained in section1471(b) or 1472(b) of the internal revenue code, as applicable), such lender shall deliver to the borrower and the designated agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the borrower or the designated agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by section1471(b)(3)(c)(i) of the internal revenue code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the borrower or the designated agent as may be necessary for the borrower and the designated agent to comply with their obligations under fatca and to determine that such lender has complied with such lenders obligations under fatca or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. solely for purposes of this clause (ii), fatca shall include any amendments made to fatca after the date of this agreement.  34 (iii)each lender that is a united states person, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this agreement in the case of each initial lender and on the date of the assumption agreement or the assignment and assumption pursuant to which it becomes a lender in the case of each other lender, and from time to time thereafter as reasonably requested in writing by the borrower (but only so long as such lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the designated agent and the borrower with two original internal revenue service forms w-9, or any successor or other form prescribed by the internal revenue service, certifying that such lender is exempt from united states federal backup withholding tax. (iv)each lender agrees that if any form or certification previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the borrower and the designated agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. (f)for any period with respect to which a lender has failed to provide the borrower with the appropriate form, certificate or other document described in section2.14(e) (other than if such failure is due to a change in law, or in the interpretation or application thereof, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form, certificate or other document originally was required to be provided, or if such form, certificate or other document otherwise is not required under subsection(e) above), such lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under section2.14(a) or (c)with respect to taxes imposed by the united states by reason of such failure; provided, however, that should a lender become subject to taxes because of its failure to deliver a form, certificate or other document required hereunder, the borrower shall take such steps as the lender shall reasonably request to assist the lender to recover such taxes. (g)any lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this section2.14 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its eurodollar lending office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such lender. (h)any lender making a claim for compensation under this section2.14 may be required to assign all of its rights and obligations hereunder upon a request by the borrower in accordance with section2.21. (i)in the event a lender is entitled, on the effective date of an assumption agreement or assignment and assumption, to the benefits of a payment pursuant to this section2.14, an assignee or novatee of such lender shall be entitled to the same benefits of payment (in addition to any future benefits of payment that may arise with respect to such assignee) that would have been available to such lender had such lender not entered into the related assumption agreement or assignment and assumption with such assignee or novatee and then only to the extent the relevant amounts are incurred by such assignee or novatee. (j)if any lender or designated agent (for purposes of this paragraph (j), an indemnified party) determines, in its sole discretion (such discretion to be exercised in good faith), that it has received a refund of any taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this section2.14 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this section2.14), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this section with respect to the taxes giving rise to such refund). such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (j)(plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such governmental authority. this paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it reasonably deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other person.  35 (k)for purposes of determining withholding taxes imposed under fatca, from and after the effective date of this agreement, the borrower and the designated agent shall treat (and the lenders hereby authorize the designated agent to treat) this amendment and restatement of the existing credit agreement and the advances as not qualifying as a grandfathered obligation within the meaning of treasury regulation section1.1471-2(b)(2)(i). section 2.15. sharing of payments, etc. if any lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its advances or other obligations hereunder resulting in such lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its advances and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a)notify the designated agent of such fact, and (b)purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the advances and such other obligations of the other lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective advances and other amounts owing them; provided that: (i)if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and (ii)the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (x)any payment made by the borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a defaulting lender), or (y)any payment obtained by a lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its advances to any assignee or participant, other than to the borrower or any subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). each loan party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each loan party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such lender were a direct creditor of each loan party in the amount of such participation. section 2.16. evidence of debt.

(c) whenever any payment hereunder or under the notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a business day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding business day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or ticking fee, as the case may be; provided, however, that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of eurodollar rate advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding business day. (d) unless the agent shall have received notice from the borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the lenders or the appropriate lenders (as applicable) hereunder that the borrower will not make such payment in full, the agent may assume that the borrower has made such payment in full to the agent on such date and the agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each lender or each appropriate lender (as applicable) on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such lender. if and to the extent the borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the agent, each such lender shall repay to the agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such lender until the date such lender repays such amount to the agent, at the federal funds rate. section 2.13. taxes.

(c) whenever any payment hereunder or under the notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a business day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding business day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or ticking fee, as the case may be; provided, however, that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of eurodollar rate advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding business day. (d) unless the agent shall have received notice from the borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the lenders or the appropriate lenders (as applicable) hereunder that the borrower will not make such payment in full, the agent may assume that the borrower has made such payment in full to the agent on such date and the agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each lender or each appropriate lender (as applicable) on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such lender. if and to the extent the borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the agent, each such lender shall repay to the agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such lender until the date such lender repays such amount to the agent, at the federal funds rate. section 2.13. taxes.

(c) whenever any payment hereunder or under the notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a business day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding business day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or ticking fee, as the case may be; provided, however, that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of eurodollar rate advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding business day. (d) unless the agent shall have received notice from the borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the lenders or the appropriate lenders (as applicable) hereunder that the borrower will not make such payment in full, the agent may assume that the borrower has made such payment in full to the agent on such date and the agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each lender or each appropriate lender (as applicable) on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such lender. if and to the extent the borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the agent, each such lender shall repay to the agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such lender until the date such lender repays such amount to the agent, at the federal funds rate. section 2.13. taxes.

(b) in addition, the borrower shall pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or under the notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder or from the execution, delivery or registration of, performing under, or otherwise with respect to, this agreement or the notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder except any such taxes that are other connection taxes imposed with respect to any assignment (other than an assignment pursuant to section2.13(g)) (hereinafter referred to as other taxes).

(b) if any lender determines that compliance with any law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or would affect the amount of capital or liquidity required or expected to be maintained by such lender or any corporation or other entity controlling such lender and that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such lenders commitment to lend  15 hereunder and other commitments of this type, then, upon demand by such lender (with a copy of such demand to the agent), the borrower shall pay to the agent for the account of such lender, from time to time as specified by such lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such lender or such corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such lender reasonably determines such increase in capital or liquidity to be allocable to the existence of such lenders commitment to lend hereunder. a certificate as to such amounts submitted to the borrower and the agent by such lender shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. for the avoidance of doubt, this section2.10(b) shall apply to all requests, rules, guidelines or directives concerning capital adequacy or liquidity issued in connection with the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives concerning capital adequacy or liquidity promulgated by the bank for international settlements, the basel committee on banking regulations and supervisory practices (or any successor or similar authority) or the united states financial regulatory authorities, regardless of the date adopted, issued, promulgated or implemented. section 2.11. illegality. notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, if any lender shall notify the agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for any lender or its eurodollar lending office to perform its obligations hereunder to make eurodollar rate advances or to fund or maintain eurodollar rate advances hereunder (a)each eurodollar rate advance will automatically, upon such demand, be converted into a base rate advance and (b)the obligation of the lenders to make eurodollar rate advances or to convert advances into eurodollar rate advances shall be suspended until the agent shall notify the borrower and the lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist; provided, however, that before making any such demand, each lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different eurodollar lending office if the making of such a designation would allow such lender or its eurodollar lending office to continue to perform its obligations to make eurodollar rate advances or to continue to fund or maintain eurodollar rate advances and would not, in the judgment of such lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such lender. section 2.12. payments and computations. (a)the borrower shall make each payment hereunder, without counterclaim or set-off, not later than 11:00a.m. (newyork city time) on the day when due in dollars to the agent at the agents account in same day funds. the agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or ticking fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to section2.10, 2.13 or 8.04(c)) to the lenders for the account of their respective applicable lending offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any lender to such lender for the account of its applicable lending office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this agreement. upon its acceptance of an assignment and assumption and recording of the information contained therein in the register pursuant to section8.06(c), from and after the effective date specified in such assignment and assumption, the agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such assignment and assumption shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.

(d) unless the agent shall have received notice from the borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the lenders hereunder that the borrower will not make such payment in full, the agent may assume that the borrower has made such payment in full to the agent on such date and the agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such lender. if and to the extent the borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the agent, each lender shall repay to the agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such lender until the date such lender repays such amount to the agent, at the federal funds rate. section 2.13. taxes.

(b) no commitment of any lender shall be increased or otherwise affected, and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this section2.17, performance by the borrower of its obligations shall not be excused or otherwise modified as a result of the operation of this section2.17. the rights and remedies against a defaulting lender under this section2.17 are in addition to any other rights and remedies which the borrower, the agent or any lender may have against such defaulting lender.
