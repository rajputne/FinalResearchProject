(b) to the fullest extent permitted by law, the obligations of each borrower shall not be affected by (i)the failure of lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce or exercise any right or remedy against any other borrower under the provisions of this agreement, any other loan document or otherwise, (ii)any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of, this agreement or any other loan document, (iii)the failure to perfect any security interest in, or the release of, any of the collateral or other security held by or on behalf of lender, or (iv)any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of any of the obligations, or by any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any borrower or that would otherwise operate as a discharge of any borrower as a matter of law or equity (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the obligations, excluding, however, any contingent indemnification obligations which are not then due and payable or for which a claim has not then been asserted). the obligations of each borrower shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the obligations, excluding, however, any contingent indemnification obligations which are not then due and payable or for which a claim has not then been asserted), including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise of any of the obligations, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the obligations or otherwise. (c) to the fullest extent permitted by law, each borrower waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any other borrower or the unenforceability of the obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any other borrower, other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the obligations, excluding, however, any contingent indemnification obligations which are not then due and payable or for which a claim has not then been asserted. lender may, at its election, foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by one or more judicial or non-judicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in lieu of  - 60 - foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the obligations, make any other accommodation with any other borrower, or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against any other borrower, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any borrower hereunder except to the extent that all of the obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash, excluding, however, any contingent indemnification obligations which are not then due and payable or for which a claim has not then been asserted. each borrower waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such borrower against any other borrower. (d) upon payment by any borrower of any obligations, all rights of such borrower against any other borrower arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full in cash of all of the obligations, excluding, however, any contingent indemnification obligations which are not then due and payable or for which a claim has not then been asserted. in addition, any indebtedness of any borrower now or hereafter held by any other borrower is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full of the obligations, excluding, however, any contingent indemnification obligations which are not then due and payable or for which a claim has not then been asserted and no borrower will demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any such indebtedness. if any amount shall erroneously be paid to any borrower on account of (i)such subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar right or (ii)any such indebtedness of any borrower, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of lender and shall forthwith be paid to lender to be credited against the payment of the obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this agreement and the other loan documents. subject to the foregoing, to the extent that any borrower shall, under this agreement as a joint and several obligor, repay any of the obligations constituting loans made to another borrower hereunder or other obligations incurred directly and primarily by any other borrower (an accommodation payment), then the borrower making such accommodation payment shall be entitled to contribution and indemnification from, and be reimbursed by, each of the other borrowers in an amount, for each of such other borrowers, equal to a fraction of such accommodation payment, the numerator of which fraction is such other borrowers allocable amount and the denominator of which is the sum of the allocable amounts of all of the borrowers. as of any date of determination, the allocable amount of each borrower shall be equal to the maximum amount of liability for accommodation payments which could be asserted against such borrower hereunder without (a)rendering such borrower insolvent within the meaning of section101 (32)of the bankruptcy code, section2 of the uniform fraudulent transfer act (ufta) or section2 of the uniform fraudulent conveyance act (ufca), (b)leaving such borrower with unreasonably small capital or assets, within the meaning of section548 of the bankruptcy code, section4 of the ufta, or section5 of the ufca, or (c)leaving such borrower unable to pay its debts as they become due within the meaning of section548 of the bankruptcy code or section4 of the ufta, or section5 of the ufca.  - 61 - [signature pages follow]  - 62 - in witness
