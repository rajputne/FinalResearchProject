remedies. no failure on the part of any party hereto to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right under this agreement or any other loan document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. the remedies of the administrative agent and the lenders provided in this agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies that they would otherwise have. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any default, regardless of whether the administrative agent or any lender may have had notice or knowledge of such default at the time. usa patriot act notice and know your customer and ofac provisions. each lender and the administrative agent (for itself and not on behalf of any lender) hereby notifies the borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the usa patriot act (title iii of pub. l. 107-56 (signed into law october26, 2003)) (the act) and pursuant to other applicable know your customer and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each borrower, which information includes the name and address of each borrower and other information that will allow such lender or the administrative agent, as applicable, to identify each borrower in accordance with the act. each borrower shall, following a request by the administrative agent or any lender, provide all documentation and other information that the administrative agent or such lender reasonably requests in order to comply with its ongoing obligations under applicable know your customer and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the act. without limiting the foregoing, if: (bb) the introduction of or any change in (or in the interpretation, administration or application of) any law or regulation made after the date of this agreement;
