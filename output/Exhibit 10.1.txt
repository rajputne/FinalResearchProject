(iv)until each lender funds its revolving loan or l/c advance pursuant to this section2.03(c) to reimburse the l/c issuer for any amount drawn under any letter of credit, interest in respect of such lenders applicable percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the l/c issuer. (v)each lenders obligation to make revolving loans or l/c advances to reimburse the l/c issuer for amounts drawn under letters of credit, as contemplated by this section 2.03(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (a)any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such lender may have against the l/c issuer, the borrower or any other person for any reason whatsoever; (b)the occurrence or continuance of a default, or (c)any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each lenders obligation to make revolving loans pursuant to this section2.03(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in section5.02 (other than delivery by the borrower of a loan notice). no such making of an l/c advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the borrower to reimburse the l/c issuer for the amount of any payment made by the l/c issuer under any letter of credit, together with interest as provided herein. (vi)if any lender fails to make available to the administrative agent for the account of the l/c issuer any amount required to be paid by such lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section2.03(c) by the time specified in section 2.03(c)(ii), then, without limiting the other provisions of this agreement, the l/c issuer shall be entitled to recover from such lender (acting through the administrative agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the l/c issuer at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the federal funds rate and a rate determined by the l/c issuer in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. a certificate of the l/c issuer submitted to any lender (through the administrative agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi)shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(c) application. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, cash collateral provided under any of this section2.14 or sections 2.03, 2.04, 2.05, 2.15 or 9.02 in respect of letters of credit or swing line loans shall be held and applied in satisfaction of the specific l/c obligations, swing line loans, obligations to fund participations therein (including, as to cash collateral provided by a defaulting lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the cash collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may be provided herein.  47  (d) release. cash collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce fronting exposure or other obligations shall be released promptly following (i)the elimination of the applicable fronting exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of defaulting lender status of the applicable lender) or (ii)the administrative agents good faith determination that there exists excess cash collateral; provided, however, (x)that cash collateral furnished by or on behalf of a loan party shall not be released during the continuance of a default or event of default (and following application as provided in this section2.14 may be otherwise applied in accordance with section9.03) and (y)the person providing cash collateral and the l/c issuer or swing line lender, as applicable, may agree that cash collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated fronting exposure or other obligations. 2.15 defaulting lenders.

(b) defaulting lender cure. if the borrower, the administrative agent, swing line lender and the l/c issuer agree in writing in their sole discretion that a defaulting lender should no longer be deemed to be a defaulting lender, the administrative agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any cash collateral), that lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding loans of the other lenders or take such other actions as the administrative agent may determined to be necessary to cause the revolving loans and funded and unfunded participations in letters of credit and swing line loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the lenders in accordance with their applicable percentages (without giving effect to section2.15(a)(iv)), whereupon that lender will cease to be a defaulting lender; provided, that, no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the borrower while that lender was a defaulting lender; provided, further, that, except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from defaulting lender to lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that lender having been a defaulting lender. 2.16 automatic debit of payments. on each date when the payment of any principal, interest or fees are due hereunder or under any note, the borrower agrees to maintain on deposit in an ordinary checking account maintained by borrower with the administrative agent (as such account shall be designated by the borrower in a written notice to the administrative agent from time to time, the  borrower account) an amount sufficient to pay such principal, interest or fees in full. the borrower hereby authorizes the administrative agent (i)to deduct automatically all principal, interest and fees when due hereunder, or under any note or notes, from the borrower account, and (ii)if and to the extent any payment under this agreement or any other loan document is not made when due, to deduct automatically any such amount from any or all of the accounts of the borrower maintained with the administrative agent. the administrative agent agrees to provide timely notice to the borrower of any automatic deduction made pursuant to this section2.16.  49  article iii taxes, yield protection and illegality 3.01 taxes.

the administrative agent, any lender or the l/c issuer determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any taxes or other taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any loan party or with respect to which any loan party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this section, it shall pay to such loan party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such loan party under this section with respect to the taxes or other taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the administrative agent, such lender or the l/c issuer, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant governmental authority with respect to such refund),

required to repay such refund to such governmental authority. this subsection shall not be construed to require the administrative agent, any lender or the l/c issuer to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the borrower or any other person.  52  3.02 illegality. if any lender determines that any law has made it unlawful, or that any governmental authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain or fund loans whose interest is determined by reference to the eurodollar rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the eurodollar rate, or any governmental authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, dollars in the london interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such lender to the borrower through the administrative agent, (i)any obligation of such lender to make or continue eurodollar rate loans or to convert base rate loans to eurodollar rate loans shall be suspended and (ii)if such notice asserts the illegality of such lender making or maintaining base rate loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the eurodollar rate component of the base rate, the interest rate on which base rate loans of such lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the administrative agent without reference to the eurodollar rate component of the base rate, in each case until such lender notifies the administrative agent and the borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. upon receipt of such notice, (x)the borrower shall, upon demand from such lender (with a copy to the administrative agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all eurodollar rate loans of such lender to base rate loans (the interest rate on which base rate loans of such lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the administrative agent without reference to the eurodollar rate component of the base rate), either on the last day of the interest period therefor, if such lender may lawfully continue to maintain such eurodollar rate loans to such day, or immediately, if such lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such eurodollar rate loans and (y)if such notice asserts the illegality of such lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the eurodollar rate, the administrative agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the base rate applicable to such lender without reference to the eurodollar rate component thereof until the administrative agent is advised in writing by such lender that it is no longer illegal for such lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the eurodollar rate. upon any such prepayment or conversion, the borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. 3.03 inability to determine rates. if the required lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a eurodollar rate loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a)dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the london interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and interest period of such eurodollar rate loan, (b)adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the eurodollar base rate for any requested interest period with respect to a proposed eurodollar rate loan or in connection with an existing or proposed base rate loan, or (c)the eurodollar base rate for any requested interest period with respect to a proposed eurodollar rate loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the lenders of funding such loan, the administrative agent will promptly notify the borrower and all lenders. thereafter, (x)the obligation of the lenders to make or maintain eurodollar rate loans shall be suspended and (y)in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the eurodollar rate component of the base rate, the utilization of the eurodollar rate component in determining the base rate shall be suspended, in each case until the administrative agent revokes such notice. upon receipt of such notice, the borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing, conversion or continuation of eurodollar rate loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a borrowing of base rate loans in the amount specified therein. 3.04 increased costs. (a) increased costs generally. if any change in law shall: (i)impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the eurodollar rate) or the l/c issuer;  53  (ii)subject any lender or the l/c issuer to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this agreement, any letter of credit, any participation in a letter of credit or any eurodollar rate loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such lender or the l/c issuer in respect thereof (except for indemnified taxes or other taxes covered by section3.01 and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any excluded tax payable by such lender or the l/c issuer); or (iii)impose on any lender or the l/c issuer or the london interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this agreement or eurodollar rate loans made by such lender or any letter of credit or participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such lender of making or maintaining any loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the eurodollar rate (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such loan), or to increase the cost to such lender or the l/c issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any letter of credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any letter of credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such lender or the l/c issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such lender or the l/c issuer, the borrower will pay to such lender or the l/c issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such lender or the l/c issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. (b) capital requirements. if any lender or the l/c issuer determines that any change in law affecting such lender or the l/c issuer or any lending office of such lender or such lenders or the l/c issuers holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such lenders or the l/c issuers capital or on the capital of such lenders or the l/c issuers holding company, if any, as a consequence of this agreement, the commitments of such lender or the loans made by, or participations in letters of credit held by, such lender, or the letters of credit issued by the l/c issuer, to a level below that which such lender or the l/c issuer or such lenders or the l/c issuers holding company could have achieved but for such change in law (taking into consideration such lenders or the l/c issuers policies and the policies of such lenders or the l/c issuers holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the borrower will pay to such lender or the l/c issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such lender or the l/c issuer or such lenders or the l/c issuers holding company for any such reduction suffered. (c) certificates for reimbursement. a certificate of a lender or the l/c issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such lender or the l/c issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a)or (b)of this section and delivered to the borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. the borrower shall pay such lender or the l/c issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10days after receipt thereof.

provided, however, that no failure by the borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of bank of america as l/c issuer or swing line lender, as the case may be. if bank of america resigns as l/c issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the l/c issuer hereunder with respect to all letters of credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as l/c issuer and all l/c obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the lenders to make base rate loans or fund risk participations in unreimbursed amounts pursuant to section 2.03(c)). if bank of america resigns as swing line lender, it shall retain all the rights of the swing line lender provided for hereunder with respect to swing line loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the lenders to make base rate loans or fund risk participations in outstanding swing line loans pursuant to section2.04(c). upon the appointment of a successor l/c issuer and/or swing line lender, (1)such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring l/c issuer or swing line lender, as the case may be, and (2) the successor l/c issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the letters of credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to bank of america to effectively assume the obligations of bank of america with respect to such letters of credit.  103  11.07 treatment of certain information;
