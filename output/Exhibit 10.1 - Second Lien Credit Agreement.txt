assignment resulting from a non-consenting lenders failure to consent to a proposed amendment, waiver, consent or release with respect to any loan document, the proposed replacement lender consents to the proposed amendment, waiver, consent or release; provided that the failure by such non-consenting lender to execute and deliver an assignment and assumption shall not impair the validity of the removal of such non-consenting lender and the mandatory assignment of such non-consenting lenders commitments and outstanding loans pursuant to this section10.13 shall nevertheless be effective without the execution by such non-consenting lender of an assignment and assumption. a lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver
