interest in (i)any leasehold interest in real property (and any fixtures relating thereto) and any fixtures relating to any owned real property to the extent that 10  the collateral agent is not entitled to a security interest with respect to such owned real property under the terms of the credit agreement, (ii)any vehicles and all proceeds thereof, (iii) any property to the extent that such grant of a security interest is (a)prohibited by any requirements of law of a governmental authority, (b)requires a consent not obtained of any governmental authority pursuant to such requirement of law or (c)prohibited by, or constitutes a breach or default under or results in the termination of or requires any consent not obtained under, any contract, license, agreement, instrument, (including

part of its business, grant licenses to third parties to use intellectual property owned, licensed or developed by a grantor. for purposes of this agreement and the other loan documents, such licensing activity shall not constitute a lien on such intellectual property. each of the administrative agent, the collateral agent and each other secured party understands that any such licenses may

(a)upon the request of the collateral agent at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under section8.1(a) or 8.1(f) of the credit agreement, each grantor shall notify obligors on the receivables that the receivables have been assigned to the collateral agent for the ratable benefit of the administrative agent, the collateral agent and the other secured parties and that payments in respect thereof shall be made directly to the collateral agent.

(b)if an event of default shall occur and be continuing and the collateral agent shall give notice of its intent to exercise such rights to the relevant grantor or grantors (which notice shall not be required if an event of default under section8.1(f) of the credit agreement shall have occurred and be continuing), (i)the collateral agent shall have the right to receive any and all cash dividends, payments or other proceeds paid in respect of the pledged securities and make application thereof to the obligations in the order set forth in section6.7, and (ii)any or all of the pledged securities shall be registered in the name of the collateral agent or its nominee, and the collateral agent or its nominee may thereafter exercise (x)all voting, corporate and other rights pertaining to such pledged securities at any meeting of shareholders of the relevant issuer or issuers or otherwise and (y)any and all rights of conversion, exchange and subscription and any other rights, privileges or options pertaining to such pledged securities as if it were the absolute owner thereof (including, without limitation, the right to exchange at its discretion any and all of the pledged securities upon the merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other fundamental change in the corporate structure of any issuer, or upon the exercise by any grantor or the collateral agent of any right, privilege or option pertaining to such pledged securities, and in connection therewith, the right to deposit and deliver any and all of the pledged securities with any committee, depositary, transfer agent, registrar or other designated agency upon such terms and conditions as the collateral agent may reasonably determine), all without liability (except liabilities resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the collateral agent) except to account for property actually received by it, but the collateral agent shall have no duty to any grantor to exercise any such right, privilege or option and shall not be responsible for any failure to do so or delay in so doing unless the collateral agent has given notice of its intent to exercise as set forth above. (c)each grantor hereby authorizes and instructs each issuer of any pledged securities pledged by such grantor hereunder to comply with any instruction received by it from the administrative agent in writing that (x)states that an event of default has occurred and is continuing and (y)is otherwise in accordance with the terms of this agreement, without any other or further instructions from such grantor, and each grantor agrees that each issuer shall be fully protected in so complying. 6.5 intellectual property. (i) solely for the purpose of enabling the collateral agent to exercise its rights and remedies under section6.8 at such time as the collateral agent shall be lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and remedies, and for no other purpose, each grantor hereby grants to the collateral agent, to the extent such grantor has the right to do so, subject to pre-existing rights and licenses, a non-exclusive license (exercisable without payment of royalty or other 15  compensation to such grantor), subject in the case of trademarks, to sufficient rights to quality control and inspection in favor of such grantor to avoid the risk of invalidation of said trademarks, to use, license or sublicense any of the intellectual property constituting collateral now owned or hereafter acquired by such grantor, wherever the same may be located. (ii) notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, but subject to the provisions of section7.5 of the credit agreement that limit the rights of the grantors to dispose of their property, notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to the collateral agents exercise of its rights and remedies under section6, the grantors will be permitted to exploit, use, enjoy, protect, license, sublicense, assign, sell, dispose of or take other actions with respect to the intellectual property in the ordinary course of the business of the grantors. in furtherance of the foregoing, so long as no event of default shall have occurred and be continuing, the collateral agent shall from time to time, upon the request of the respective grantor (through the borrower), execute and deliver any instruments, certificates or other documents, in the form so requested, that such grantor (through the borrower) shall have certified are appropriate in its judgment to allow it to take any action permitted above (including relinquishment of the license provided pursuant to clause (i)immediately above as to any specific intellectual property). further, upon the payment in full in cash of all of the obligations (other than borrower hedge agreement obligations, borrower cash management obligations and contingent or indemnification obligations not then due) and cancellation or termination of all commitments and letters of credit (that are not cash collateralized or back-stopped to the reasonable satisfaction of the issuing lender or purchasing lender, as applicable, in respect thereof) or earlier expiration of this agreement or release of the collateral, the collateral agent shall grant back to the grantors the license granted pursuant to clause (i)immediately above. the exercise of rights and remedies under section6 by the collateral agent shall not terminate the rights of the holders of any licenses or sublicenses theretofore granted by the grantors in accordance with the first sentence of this clause (ii). 6.6 proceeds to be turned over to collateral agent. if an event of default shall occur and be continuing and the loans shall have been accelerated pursuant to section8 of the credit agreement, all proceeds received by any grantor consisting of cash, checks and other near-cash items shall be held by such grantor in trust for the administrative agent, the collateral agent and the other secured parties, segregated from other funds of such grantor, and shall, promptly upon receipt by such grantor, be turned over to the collateral agent in the exact form received by such grantor (duly indorsed by such grantor to the collateral agent, if required). all proceeds received by the collateral agent hereunder shall be held by the collateral agent in a collateral account maintained under its sole dominion and control. all proceeds while held by the collateral agent in a collateral account (or by such grantor in trust for the administrative agent, the collateral agent and the other secured parties) shall continue to be held as collateral security for all of the obligations and shall not constitute payment thereof until applied as provided in section6.7. 6.7 application of proceeds. if an event of default shall have occurred and be continuing and the loans shall have been accelerated pursuant to section8 of the credit agreement, at any time at the collateral agents election, the collateral agent may apply all or any part of proceeds constituting collateral and any proceeds of the guarantee set forth in section2, in payment of the obligations, and shall make any such application in the following order:  first, to pay incurred and unpaid reasonable, out-of-pocket fees and expenses of the agents under the loan documents; 16   second, to the collateral agent, for application by it towards payment in full of all unfunded advances/participations (the amounts so applied to be distributed between or among the administrative agent, the swingline lender and any issuing lender pro rata in accordance with the amounts of unfunded advances/participations owed to them on the date of any such distribution);  third, to the collateral agent, for application by it towards payment of amounts then due and owing and remaining unpaid in respect of the obligations, pro rata among the secured parties according to the amounts of the obligations then due and owing and remaining unpaid to each of them; and  fourth, any balance of such proceeds remaining after the obligations shall have been paid in full (other than contingent or indemnification obligations not then due), no letter of credit (that is not cash collateralized to the reasonable satisfaction of the issuing lender or purchasing lender, as applicable, in respect thereof) shall be outstanding and the commitments shall have been terminated, shall be paid over to the borrower or to whomsoever shall be lawfully entitled to receive the same. 6.8 code and other remedies. if an event of default shall occur and be continuing, the collateral agent, on behalf of itself, the administrative agent and the other secured parties, may exercise, in addition to all other rights and remedies granted to them in this agreement and in any other instrument or agreement securing, evidencing or relating to the obligations, all rights and remedies of a secured party under the new york ucc or any other applicable law. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the collateral agent, without demand of performance or other demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any notice required by law referred to below or notices otherwise provided in the loan documents) to or upon any grantor or any other person (all and each of which demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby waived unless otherwise provided in the loan documents), may in such circumstances forthwith collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the collateral, or any part thereof, and/or may forthwith, subject to pre-existing rights and licenses, sell, lease, assign, give option or options to purchase, or otherwise dispose of and deliver the collateral or any part thereof (or contract to do any of the foregoing), in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any exchange, brokers board or office of the administrative agent, the collateral agent or any other secured party or elsewhere upon such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable and at such prices as it may deem best, for cash or on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk. the administrative agent, the collateral agent or any other secured party shall have the right upon any such public sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase the whole or any part of the collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption, stay or appraisal in any grantor, which rights or equities are hereby waived and released. each grantor further agrees, at the collateral agents request, to assemble the collateral and make it available to the collateral agent at places which the collateral agent shall reasonably select, whether at such grantors premises or elsewhere. the collateral agent shall apply the net proceeds of any action taken by it pursuant to this section 6.8, after deducting all reasonable costs and expenses of every kind actually incurred in connection therewith or incidental to the care or safekeeping of any of the collateral or in any way relating to the collateral or the rights of the administrative agent, the collateral agent and the other secured parties hereunder, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements, to the payment in whole or in part of the obligations, in such order as the collateral agent may elect, and only after such application and after the payment by the collateral agent of any other amount required by any provision of law, including, without limitation, section 9-615(a)(3) of the new york ucc, need the collateral agent account for the surplus, if any, to any grantor. if any notice of a proposed sale or other disposition of collateral shall be required by law, such notice shall be deemed reasonable and proper if given at least 10days before such sale or other disposition. 17  6.9 private sales. each grantor recognizes that the collateral agent may be unable to effect a public sale of any or all the pledged stock, by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the securities act and applicable state securities laws or otherwise, and may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted group of purchasers which will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. each grantor acknowledges and agrees that any such private sale may result in prices and other terms less favorable than if such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner. the collateral agent shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any of the pledged stock for the period of time necessary to permit the issuer thereof to register such securities for public sale under the securities act, or under applicable state securities laws, even if such issuer would agree to do so. 6.10 deficiency. each grantor shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the collateral are insufficient to pay its obligations and the reasonable fees and disbursements of any attorneys employed by the collateral agent to collect such deficiency. section 7. the collateral agent 7.1 collateral agents appointment as attorney-in-fact, etc. (a)each grantor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the collateral agent and any officer or agent thereof, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead of such grantor and in the name of such grantor or in its own name, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of this agreement, to take any and all appropriate action and to execute any and all documents and instruments which may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this agreement, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each grantor hereby gives the collateral agent the power and right, on behalf of such grantor, without notice to or assent by such grantor, to do any or all of the following ( provided that anything in this section7.1(a) to the contrary notwithstanding, the collateral agent agrees that it will not exercise any rights under the power of attorney provided for in this section7.1(a) unless an event of default shall have occurred and be continuing): (i) in the name of such grantor or its own name, or otherwise, take possession of and indorse and collect any checks, drafts, notes, acceptances or other instruments for the payment of moneys due under any receivable or with respect to any other collateral and file any claim or take any other action or proceeding in any court of law or equity or otherwise deemed appropriate by the collateral agent for the purpose of collecting any and all such moneys due under any receivable or with respect to any other collateral whenever payable; (ii) in the case of any united states copyrights, patents or trademarks owned by such grantor in its own name, execute and deliver, and have recorded, any and all agreements, instruments, documents and papers as the

goodwill and general intangibles of such grantor relating thereto or represented thereby; 18  (iii) pay or discharge taxes and liens levied or placed on or threatened against the collateral, effect

shall in its reasonable discretion determine; and (8)subject to pre-existing rights and licenses, generally, sell, transfer, pledge and make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with any of the collateral as fully and completely as though the collateral agent were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and do, at the collateral agents option and such grantors expense, at any time, or from time to time, all acts and things which the collateral agent deems necessary to protect, preserve or realize upon the collateral and the administrative agents, the collateral agents and the other secured parties security interests therein and to effect the intent of this agreement, all as fully and effectively as such grantor might do.

(c)each grantor hereby ratifies all that said attorneys shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. all powers, authorizations and agencies contained in this agreement are coupled with an interest and are irrevocable until this agreement is terminated and the security interests created hereby are released. 7.2 duty of collateral agent. to the extent permitted by law, the collateral agents sole duty with respect to the custody, safekeeping and physical preservation of the collateral in its possession, under section9-207 of the new york ucc or otherwise, shall be to deal with it in the same manner as the collateral agent deals with similar property for its own account. none of the administrative agent, the collateral agent, any other secured party or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or 19  agents shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any of the collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any collateral upon the request of any grantor or any other person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to the collateral or any part thereof. the powers conferred on the administrative agent, the collateral agent and the other secured parties hereunder are solely to protect the administrative agents, the collateral agents and the other secured parties interests in the collateral and shall not impose any duty upon the administrative agent, the collateral agent or any other secured party to exercise any such powers. the administrative agent, the collateral agent and the other secured parties shall be accountable only for amounts that they actually receive as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither they nor any of their officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to any grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct or that of their directors, officers, employees or agents. 7.3 execution of financing statements. pursuant to any applicable law, each grantor authorizes the collateral agent at any time and from time to time to file or record financing statements (including fixture filings, if any, and amendments) and other filing or recording documents or instruments with respect to the collateral without the signature of such grantor in such form and in such offices as the collateral agent reasonably determines appropriate to perfect the security interests of the collateral agent under this agreement. each grantor authorizes the collateral agent to use the collateral description all personal property, all assets or any similar phrase in any such financing statements. each grantor agrees to provide such information as the collateral agent may reasonably request necessary to enable the collateral agent to make any such filings promptly following any such request. notwithstanding anything herein or in any other loan document to the contrary, the delivery of control agreements with respect to any deposit accounts (other than those relating to material deposit accounts pursuant to section5.4), securities accounts (other than those relating to material securities accounts pursuant to section 5.4) and commodities accounts shall not be required. 7.4 authority of collateral agent. each grantor acknowledges that the rights and responsibilities of the collateral agent under this agreement with respect to any action taken by the collateral agent or the exercise or non-exercise by the collateral agent of any option, voting right, request, judgment or other right or remedy provided for herein or resulting or arising out of this agreement shall, as among the administrative agent, the collateral agent and the other secured parties, be governed by the credit agreement and by such other agreements with respect thereto as may exist from time to time among them, but, as between the collateral agent and the grantors, the collateral agent shall be conclusively presumed to be acting as agent for the administrative agent, the collateral agent and the other secured parties with full and valid authority so to act or refrain from acting, and no grantor shall be under any obligation, or entitlement, to make any inquiry respecting such authority. section 8. miscellaneous 8.1 amendments in writing. none of the terms or provisions of this agreement may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except in accordance with section10.1 of the credit agreement. 8.2 notices. all notices, requests and demands to or upon the collateral agent or any grantor hereunder shall be effected in the manner provided for in section10.2 of the credit agreement;

cumulative remedies. neither the administrative agent, the collateral agent nor any other secured party shall by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to section8.1), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any default or event of default. no failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of the administrative agent, the collateral agent or any other secured party, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. no single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. a waiver by the administrative agent, the collateral agent or any other secured party of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy which the administrative agent, the collateral agent or such other secured party would otherwise have on any future occasion. the rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law. 8.4 enforcement expenses; indemnification. each guarantor agrees to pay, and to save the administrative agent, the collateral agent and the other secured parties harmless from, any and all out-of-pocket liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and administration of this agreement to the extent the borrower would be required to do so pursuant to section10.5 of the credit agreement. the agreements in this section8.4 shall survive repayment of the obligations and all other amounts payable under the credit agreement and the other loan documents. 8.5 successors and assigns. this agreement shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of each grantor and shall inure to the benefit of the administrative agent, the collateral agent and the other secured parties and their successors and assigns;
