(c) the security interest constitutes (i)a legal and valid security interest in all the article9 collateral securing the payment and performance of the secured obligations, (ii)a perfected security interest in all article9 collateral in which a security interest may be perfected by the filings described in paragraph (b)of this section3.02. the security interest is and shall be prior to any other lien on any of the article9 collateral, other than liens permitted pursuant to section6.02 of the credit agreement.

(a) each grantor shall, at its own expense, take any and all commercially reasonable actions to defend the security interest of the administrative agent in the article9 collateral and the priority thereof against any lien not permitted pursuant to section6.02 of the credit agreement. (b) each grantor agrees, at its own expense, to execute, acknowledge, deliver and cause to be duly filed all such further instruments and documents and take all such actions as the administrative agent may from time to time reasonably request to preserve, protect and perfect the security interest and the rights and remedies created hereby, including the payment of any fees and taxes required in connection with the execution and delivery of this agreement, the granting of the security interest and the filing of any financing statements (including fixture filings) or other documents in connection herewith or therewith. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each grantor hereby authorizes the administrative agent, with prompt written notice thereof to the grantors, to supplement this agreement by supplementing scheduleii hereto or adding additional schedules hereto to identify specifically any asset or item that may constitute an application, registration or issuance of or for any copyright, patent or trademark; provided that any grantor shall have the right, exercisable within 30days (or such longer period as shall be agreed by the borrower and the administrative agent) after it has been notified in writing by the administrative agent of the specific identification of such collateral, to advise the administrative agent in writing of any inaccuracy (i)with respect to such supplement or additional schedule or (ii)of the representations and warranties made by such grantor hereunder with respect to such collateral. each grantor agrees that, at the reasonable request of the administrative agent, it will use commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as shall be reasonably necessary in order that all representations and warranties hereunder shall be true and correct in all material respects with respect to such collateral within 60days (or such longer period as shall be agreed by the borrower and the administrative agent) after the date it has been notified in writing by the administrative agent of the specific identification of such collateral. (c) at its option, the administrative agent may discharge past due taxes, assessments, charges, fees, liens, security interests or other encumbrances at any time levied or placed on the article9 collateral and not permitted pursuant to the credit agreement, and may pay for the maintenance and preservation of the article9 collateral to the extent any grantor fails to do so as required by the credit agreement (giving effect to any grace periods), this agreement or any other loan document and within a reasonable period of time after the administrative agent has requested that it do so, and each grantor jointly and severally agrees to reimburse the administrative agent, promptly after demand, for any reasonable payment made or any reasonable expense incurred by the administrative agent pursuant to the foregoing authorization; provided that nothing in this paragraph shall be interpreted as excusing any grantor from the performance of, or imposing any obligation on the administrative agent or any secured party to cure or perform, any covenants or other promises of any grantor with respect to taxes, assessments, charges, fees, liens, security interests or other encumbrances and maintenance as set forth herein or in the other loan documents.  -13- (d) each grantor shall remain liable, as between such grantor and the relevant counterparty under each contract, agreement or instrument relating to the article 9 collateral, to observe and perform all the conditions and obligations to be observed and performed by it under such contract, agreement or instrument, all in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, and each grantor jointly and severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the administrative agent and the other secured parties from and against any and all liability for such performance to the extent contemplated by section9.03 of the credit agreement. (e) it is understood that no grantor shall be required by this agreement to perfect the security interests created hereunder by any means other than (i)filings pursuant to the uniform commercial code, (ii)filings with the united states patent and trademark office or united states copyright office (or any successor office) in respect of registered, issued or applied for intellectual property (provided that, with respect to licenses, such filings shall be limited to exclusive copyright licenses under which such grantor is a licensee), (iii)in the case of collateral that constitutes pledged securities, instruments, or certificated securities, delivery thereof to the administrative agent in accordance with the terms hereof (together with, where applicable, undated stock or note powers or other undated proper instruments of assignment) and (iv)as expressly contemplated hereunder. no grantor shall be required to (i)deliver control agreements with respect to, or confer perfection by control over, any deposit accounts, securities accounts, or other collateral (other than pledged collateral and letter-of-credit rights (to the extent required hereby)) for which perfection may be conferred by control, or (ii)perfect cash by possession. (f) each grantor irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints the administrative agent (and all officers, employees or agents designated by the administrative agent) as such grantors true and lawful agent (and attorney-in-fact) for the purpose of making, settling and adjusting claims in respect of article9 collateral under policies of insurance, endorsing the name of such grantor on any check, draft, instrument or other item of payment for the proceeds of such policies of insurance and for making all determinations and decisions with respect thereto; provided that the administrative agent agrees not to exercise any rights as agent except following the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default after providing notice to the borrower of its intent to exercise such rights. in the event that any grantor at any time or times shall fail to pay any premium in whole or part relating to insurance covering any of the article 9 collateral and such failure results in an event of default, the administrative agent may upon notice to the borrower, without waiving or releasing any obligation or liability of the grantors hereunder or any event of default, in its sole discretion, obtain and maintain such policies of insurance and pay such premium and take any other actions with respect thereto as the administrative agent reasonably deems advisable. all sums disbursed by the administrative agent in connection with this paragraph, including reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys fees, court costs, expenses and other charges relating thereto, shall be payable, promptly after demand, by the grantors to the administrative agent and shall be additional secured obligations secured hereby.  -14- (g) if any grantor is at any time a beneficiary under a letter of credit with a face value in excess of $5,000,000 now or hereafter issued, such grantor shall promptly notify the administrative agent thereof and such grantor shall, at the request of the administrative agent, pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the administrative agent, either (i)use commercially reasonable efforts to arrange for the issuer and any confirmer of such letter of credit to consent to an assignment to the administrative agent of the proceeds of any drawing under the letter of credit or (ii)use commercially reasonable efforts to arrange for the administrative agent to become the transferee beneficiary of such letter of credit, with the administrative agent agreeing, in each case, that the proceeds of any drawing under the letter of credit are to be applied as provided in the credit agreement. section 3.04. commercial tort claims. if any grantor shall at any time hold or acquire a commercial tort claim, such grantor shall promptly notify the administrative agent thereof in a writing signed by such grantor, including a summary description of such claim, and scheduleiii hereto shall be deemed to be supplemented to include such description of such commercial tort claim as set forth in such writing. section 3.05. covenants regarding patent, trademark and copyright collateral. (a) except as permitted by the credit agreement or to the extent failure to act could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect of the type referred to in clause (a)or (b)of the definition of such term in the credit agreement, each grantor agrees to take all reasonable steps, including in any proceeding before the united states patent and trademark office and the united states copyright office, to pursue any application and maintain and renew any registration or issuance of each patent, trademark or copyright and to protect the validity and enforceability of the intellectual property. (b) except as permitted by the credit agreement or as could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect of the type referred to in clause (a)or (b)of the definition of such term in the credit agreement, no grantor shall do or permit any act or knowingly omit to do any act whereby any of its intellectual property may lapse, be terminated, or become invalid or unenforceable or dedicated to the public (or in case of a trade secret, lose its competitive value). (c) except as permitted by the credit agreement or where failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect of the type referred to in clause (a)or (b)of the definition of such term in the credit agreement, each grantor shall take all steps to preserve and protect each item of its intellectual property, including maintaining the quality of any and all products or services used or provided in connection with any of the trademarks, consistent with the quality of the products and services as of the date hereof, and taking all steps necessary to ensure that all licensed users of any of the trademarks abide by the applicable licenses terms with respect to the standards of quality. (d) each grantor (and in the case of any foreign grantor, solely with respect to us intellectual property) agrees that, should it obtain an ownership or other interest in any intellectual property after the effective date, (i)the provisions of this agreement shall automatically apply thereto, (ii)any such intellectual property and, in the case of trademarks, the goodwill symbolized thereby, shall automatically become intellectual property subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement  -15- and (iii)such grantor shall at the end of each fiscal quarter provide a notice to the administrative agent and prepare a copyright security agreement, a patent security agreement or a trademark security agreement, as applicable, for filing with the united states patent and trademark office or united states copyright office. (e) nothing in this agreement shall prevent any grantor from disposing of, discontinuing the use or maintenance of, failing to preserve, protect, pursue, renew, extend or keep in full force and effect, or otherwise allow to lapse, terminate, become invalid or unenforceable or dedicate to the public domain any of its intellectual property, to the extent permitted by the credit agreement. article iv remedies section 4.01. remedies upon default. upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, each grantor agrees to deliver, on demand, each item of collateral to the administrative agent or any person designated by the administrative agent, and it is agreed that the administrative agent shall have the right to take any of or all the following actions at the same or different times subject to the mandatory requirements of applicable law: (a)with respect to any article9 collateral consisting of intellectual property, on demand, to cause the security interest to become an assignment, transfer and conveyance of any of or all such article 9 collateral by the applicable grantors to the administrative agent, for the benefit of the secured parties, or to license or sublicense, whether on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis, any such article 9 collateral throughout the world on such terms and conditions and in such manner as the administrative agent shall determine (in each case, other than in violation of any then-existing rights or licensing arrangements to the extent that waivers cannot be obtained), and (b)with or without legal process and with or without prior notice or demand for performance, to take possession of the article 9 collateral and the pledged collateral and without liability for trespass to enter any premises where the article 9 collateral or the pledged collateral may be located for the purpose of taking possession of or removing the article 9 collateral and the pledged collateral and, generally, to exercise any and all rights afforded to a secured party under the uniform commercial code or other applicable law. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each grantor agrees that the administrative agent shall have the right, subject to the mandatory requirements of applicable law, then-existing rights and licenses and the notice requirements described below, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the collateral at a public or private sale or at any brokers board or on any securities exchange, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the administrative agent shall deem appropriate. the administrative agent shall be authorized at any such sale of securities (if it deems it advisable to do so) to restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers to persons who will represent and agree that they are purchasing the collateral for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or sale thereof, and upon consummation of any such sale the administrative agent shall have the right to assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the collateral so sold. each such purchaser at any sale of collateral shall hold the property sold absolutely free from any claim or right on the part of any grantor, and each grantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay and appraisal that such grantor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted.  -16- the administrative agent shall give the applicable grantors no less than 10days written notice (which each grantor agrees is reasonable notice within the meaning of section9-611 of the newyork ucc or its equivalent in other jurisdictions) of the administrative agents intention to make any sale of collateral. such notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for such sale and, in the case of a sale at a brokers board or on a securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on which the collateral or portion thereof, will first be offered for sale at such board or exchange. any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the administrative agent may fix and state in the notice (if any) of such sale. subject to pre-existing rights and licenses, at any such sale, the collateral, or portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the administrative agent may (in its sole discretion) determine. the administrative agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such collateral shall have been given. the administrative agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned. in case any sale of all or any part of the collateral is made on credit or for future delivery, the collateral so sold may be retained by the administrative agent until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but the administrative agent and the other secured parties shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such collateral may be sold again upon like notice. at any public (or, to the extent permitted by law, private) sale made pursuant to this agreement, any secured party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of any grantor (all said rights being also hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by law), the collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any claim then due and payable to such secured party from any grantor as a credit against the purchase price, and such secured party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to any grantor therefor. for purposes hereof, a written agreement to purchase the collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof; the administrative agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and no grantor shall be entitled to the return of the collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the administrative agent shall have entered into such an agreement all events of default shall have been remedied and the secured obligations paid in full. as an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the administrative agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose this agreement and to sell the collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver. any sale pursuant to the provisions of this section4.01 shall be deemed, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to conform to the commercially reasonable standards as provided in section9-610(b) of the newyork ucc or its equivalent in other jurisdictions.  -17- section 4.02. application of proceeds. the administrative agent shall, subject to the intercreditor agreement, apply the proceeds of any collection or sale of collateral, including any collateral consisting of cash, as follows: first, to the payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the administrative agent in connection with such collection or sale or otherwise in connection with this agreement, any other loan document or any of the secured obligations, including all court costs and the fees and expenses of its agents and legal counsel, the repayment of all advances made by the administrative agent hereunder or under any other loan document on behalf of any grantor and any other costs or expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other loan document and all administrative agents fees; second, to the payment in full of the secured obligations (the amounts so applied to be distributed among the secured parties pro rata in accordance with the amounts of the secured obligations owed to them on the date of any such distribution); and third, to the grantors, their successors or assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. the administrative agent shall have absolute discretion as to the time of application of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this agreement. upon any sale of collateral by the administrative agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the administrative agent or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the collateral so sold and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the administrative agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof. the administrative agent shall have no liability to any of the secured parties for actions taken in reliance on information supplied to it as to the amounts of unpaid principal and interest and other amounts outstanding with respect to the secured obligations. section 4.03. grant of license to use intellectual property. for the purpose of enabling the administrative agent to exercise rights and remedies under this agreement, each grantor hereby grants to the administrative agent an irrevocable non-exclusive license (exercisable without payment of royalty or other compensation to the grantors) solely during the continuance of an event of default to use, license or sublicense any of the collateral consisting of intellectual property now owned or hereafter acquired by such grantor, and wherever the same may be located, and including in such license reasonable access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer software and programs used for the compilation or printout thereof to the extent that such non-exclusive license (a)does not violate the express terms of any agreement between a grantor and a third party governing the applicable grantors use of such collateral consisting of intellectual property, or gives such third party any right of acceleration, modification or cancellation therein and (b)is not prohibited by any requirements of law; provided that such licenses granted hereunder with respect to trademarks shall be subject to the maintenance of quality standards with respect to the goods and services on which such trademarks are used sufficient to preserve the validity of such trademarks. the use of such license by the administrative agent may be exercised, at the option of the administrative agent, during the continuation of an event of default; provided further that any license, sublicense or other transaction entered into by the administrative agent in accordance herewith shall be binding upon the grantors notwithstanding any subsequent cure of an event of default.  -18- section 4.04. securities act. in view of the position of the grantors in relation to the pledged collateral, or because of other current or future circumstances, a question may arise under the securities act of 1933, as now or hereafter in effect, or any similar statute hereafter enacted analogous in purpose or effect (such act and any such similar statute as from time to time in effect being called the federal securities laws) with respect to any disposition of the pledged collateral permitted hereunder. each grantor understands that compliance with the federal securities laws might very strictly limit the course of conduct of the administrative agent if the administrative agent were to attempt to dispose of all or any part of the pledged collateral, and might also limit the extent to which or the manner in which any subsequent transferee of any pledged collateral could dispose of the same. similarly, there may be other legal restrictions or limitations affecting the administrative agent in any attempt to dispose of all or part of the pledged collateral under applicable blue sky or other state securities laws or similar laws analogous in purpose or effect. each grantor recognizes that in light of such restrictions and limitations the administrative agent may, with respect to any sale of the pledged collateral, limit the purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire such pledged collateral for their own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. each grantor acknowledges and agrees that in light of such restrictions and limitations, the administrative agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, (a)may proceed to make such a sale whether or not a registration statement for the purpose of registering such pledged collateral or part thereof shall have been filed under the federal securities laws to the extent the administrative agent has determined that such a registration is not required by any requirement of law and (b)may approach and negotiate with a limited number of potential purchasers (including a single potential purchaser) to effect such sale. each grantor acknowledges and agrees that any such sale might result in prices and other terms less favorable to the seller than if such sale were a public sale without such restrictions. in the event of any such sale, the administrative agent and the other secured parties shall incur no responsibility or liability for selling all or any part of the pledged collateral at a price that the administrative agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, may in good faith deem reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially higher price might have been realized if the sale were deferred until after registration as aforesaid or if more than a limited number of purchasers (or a single purchaser) were approached. the provisions of this section4.04 will apply notwithstanding the existence of a public or private market upon which the quotations or sales prices may exceed substantially the price at which the administrative agent sells. section 4.05. remedies cumulative. each and every right, power and remedy hereby specifically given to the administrative agent shall be in addition to every other right, power and remedy specifically given to the administrative agent under this agreement, the other security documents or now or hereafter existing at law, in equity or by statute and each and every right, power and remedy whether specifically herein given or otherwise existing may be exercised from time to time or simultaneously and as often and in such order as may be deemed expedient by the administrative agent. all such rights, powers and remedies shall be cumulative and the exercise or the beginning of the exercise of one shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to exercise any other or others. no delay or omission of the administrative agent in the exercise of any such right, power or remedy and no renewal or extension of any of the loan document obligations shall impair any such right, power or remedy or shall be construed to be a waiver of any default or event of default or an acquiescence thereof. no notice to or demand on any grantor in any case shall entitle it to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of any of the rights of the administrative agent to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.  -19- in the event that the administrative agent shall bring any suit to enforce any of its rights hereunder and shall be entitled to judgment, then in such suit the administrative agent may recover its expenses, including attorneys fees and expenses, and the amounts thereof shall be included in such judgment article v miscellaneous section 5.01. notices. all communications and notices hereunder shall (except as otherwise expressly permitted herein) be in writing and given as provided in section9.01 of the credit agreement. all communications and notices hereunder to any grantor shall be given to it in care of borrower as provided in section9.01 of the credit agreement. section 5.02. waivers; amendment. (a) no failure or delay by the administrative agent, any issuing bank or any lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other loan document shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. the rights and remedies of the administrative agent, the issuing banks and the lenders hereunder and under the other loan documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. no waiver of any provision of this agreement or consent to any departure by any loan party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph(b) of this section5.02, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a loan or issuance of a letter of credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any default, regardless of whether the administrative agent, any lender or any issuing bank may have had notice or knowledge of such default at the time. no notice or demand on any loan party in any case shall entitle any loan party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. (b) neither this agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the administrative agent and the grantor or grantors with respect to which such waiver, amendment or modification is to apply, subject to any consent required in accordance with section9.02 of the credit agreement; provided that the administrative agent may, without the consent of any secured party, consent to a departure by any grantor from any covenant of such grantor set forth herein to the extent such departure is consistent with the authority of the administrative agent set forth in the definition of the term collateral and guarantee requirement in the credit agreement. section 5.03. administrative agents fees and expenses; indemnification. (a) each grantor, jointly with the other grantors and severally, agrees to reimburse the administrative agent for its fees and expenses incurred hereunder as provided in section9.03(a) of the credit agreement; provided that each reference therein to the borrower shall be deemed to be a reference to each grantor.  -20- (b) without limitation of its indemnification obligations under the other loan documents, each grantor, jointly with the other grantors and severally, agrees to indemnify the administrative agent and the other indemnitees against, and hold each indemnitee harmless from any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and reasonable and documented or invoiced out-of-pocket fees and expenses of any counsel for any indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any indemnitee by any third party or by the borrower, holdings or any subsidiary arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of the execution, delivery or performance of this agreement or any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the borrower, holdings or any subsidiary and regardless of whether any indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgment to have resulted from (x)the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such indemnitee or such indemnitees affiliates or any of its or their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, controlling persons or members, (y)a material breach of a funding obligation under the loan documents by the administrative agent, an issuing bank, a lender, the documentation agent, the syndication agents or the joint bookrunners or (z)any claim, action, suit, inquiry, litigation, investigation or proceeding that does not involve an act or omission of the borrower or any of its affiliates and that is brought by an indemnitee against any other indemnitee (other than any claim, action, suit, inquiry, litigation, investigation or proceeding against the administrative agent in its capacity as such). (c) to the extent permitted by applicable law, no grantor shall assert, and each grantor hereby waives, any claim against any indemnitee (i)for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of information or other materials distributed to such unintended recipients by such indemnitee through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems (including the internet) in connection with this agreement or the other loan documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any indemnitee, be available to the extent that such damages are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final, non-appealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such indemnitee or (ii)on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this agreement, any other loan document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the transactions, any loan or letter of credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.
