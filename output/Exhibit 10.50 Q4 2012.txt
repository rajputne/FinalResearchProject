officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, attorneys-in-fact or controlling persons shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such person under or in connection with this agreement or any other loan document (except to the extent that any of the foregoing are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from its or such person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made

transfer thereof shall have been filed with the administrative agent. the administrative agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this agreement or any other loan document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the majority lenders (or, if so specified by this agreement, all lenders) as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. the administrative agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this agreement and the other loan documents in accordance with a request of the majority lenders (or, if so specified by this

notice, the administrative agent shall give notice thereof to the lenders. the administrative agent shall take such action with respect to such default or event of default as shall be reasonably directed by the majority lenders (or, if so specified by this agreement, all lenders); provided that unless and until the administrative agent shall have received such directions, the administrative

that no act by administrative agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of a loan party or any affiliate of a loan party, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by administrative agent to any lender. each lender represents to administrative agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon administrative agent or any other lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the loan parties and their affiliates and made its own decision to make its loans hereunder and enter into this agreement. each lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon administrative agent or any other lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this agreement and the other loan documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the loan parties and their affiliates. except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the lenders by the administrative agent hereunder, the administrative agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of any loan party or any affiliate of a loan party that may come into the possession of the administrative agent or its affiliates or any of its or their officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, attorneys-in-fact or controlling persons. 10.7 indemnification . the lenders agree to indemnify administrative agent in its capacity as such, its affiliates (other than the company and its subsidiaries) and its and such affiliates' officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, attorneys-in-fact and controlling persons (each, an  agent indemnitee ) (to the extent not reimbursed by the borrowers and without limiting the obligation of the borrowers to do so), ratably according to their respective aggregate exposure percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this section (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the commitments shall have terminated and the loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with such aggregate exposure percentages immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether before or after the payment of the loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any agent indemnitee in any way relating to or arising out of, the commitments, this agreement, any of the other loan documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such agent indemnitee under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, 54 losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such agent indemnitee's gross negligence or willful misconduct. the agreements in this section shall survive the termination of this agreement and the payment of the loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 10.8 agent in its individual capacity . the administrative agent and its affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with any loan party as though administrative agent were not the administrative agent. with respect to its loans made or renewed by it and with respect to any letter of credit issued or participated in by it, administrative agent shall have the same rights and powers under this agreement and the other loan documents as any lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the administrative agent, and the terms lender and lenders shall include administrative agent in its individual capacity. 10.9 successor administrative agent . the administrative agent may resign as administrative agent upon 10 days' notice to the lenders and the company. if the administrative agent shall resign as administrative agent under this agreement and the other loan documents, then the majority lenders shall appoint from among the lenders a successor agent for the lenders, which successor agent shall (unless an event of default under section 9(a) or section 9(i) with respect to a borrower shall have occurred and be continuing) be subject to approval by the company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the administrative agent, and the term administrative agent shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former administrative agent's rights, powers and duties as administrative agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former administrative agent or any of the parties to this agreement or any holders of the loans. if no successor agent has accepted appointment as administrative agent by the date that is ten (10) days following a retiring administrative agent's notice of resignation, the retiring administrative agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective, and the lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the administrative agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the majority lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above. after any retiring administrative agent's resignation as administrative agent, the provisions of this section 10 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was administrative agent under this agreement and the other loan documents. section 11. miscellaneous 11.1 amendments and waivers . neither this agreement, any other loan document, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended,

with the consent of the majority 55 lenders); and (z) that any amendment or modification of defined terms used in the financial covenants in this agreement shall not constitute a reduction in the rate of interest or fees for purposes of this clause (i)) or extend the scheduled date of any payment thereof, or increase the amount or extend the expiration date of any lender's commitment, or otherwise change the time, place or the currency of payments to be made on the loans, in each case without the written consent of each lender directly affected thereby; (ii) reduce any percentage specified in the definition of majority lenders without the written consent of all lenders, (iii) except to the extent contemplated by the loan documents, release all or substantially all of the collateral or

future holders of the loans. in the case of any waiver, the loan parties, the lenders and the administrative agent shall be restored to their former position and rights hereunder and under the other loan documents, and any default or event of default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or event of default, or impair any right consequent thereon. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section 11.1 : (a) the guarantee agreement, the security documents and related documents executed by the borrowers or subsidiaries in connection with this agreement may be in a form reasonably determined by the administrative agent and may be, together with this agreement, amended, supplemented and waived with the consent of the administrative agent at the request of the company without the need to obtain the consent of any other lender if such amendment, supplement or waiver is delivered in
