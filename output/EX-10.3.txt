(b)all payments in respect of the principal amount of any loan (other than voluntary prepayments of revolving loans that are base rate loans) shall be accompanied by payment of accrued interest on the principal amount being repaid or prepaid, and all such payments (and, in any event, any payments in respect of any loan on a date when interest is due and payable with respect to such loan) shall be applied to the payment of interest then due and payable before application to principal.  -71- (c)administrative agent (or its agent or sub-agent appointed by it) shall promptly distribute to each lender at such address as such lender shall indicate in writing, such lenders applicable pro rata share of all payments and prepayments of principal and interest due hereunder, together with all other amounts due thereto, including, all fees payable with respect thereto, to the extent received by administrative agent. (d)notwithstanding the foregoing provisions hereof, if any conversion/continuation notice is withdrawn as to any affected lender or if any affected lender makes base rate loans in lieu of its pro rata share of any eurodollar rate loans, administrative agent shall give effect thereto in apportioning payments received thereafter. (e)subject to the provisos set forth in the definition of interest period as they may apply to revolving loans, whenever any payment to be made hereunder with respect to any loan shall be stated to be due on a day that is not a business day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding business day and, with respect to revolving loans only, such extension of time shall be included in the computation of the payment of interest hereunder or of the revolving commitment fees hereunder. (f)except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by borrower hereunder shall be made to administrative agent, for the account of the respective lenders to which such payment is owed, in dollars and otherwise in the manner set forth in clause (a)of this section2.16. (g)administrative agent shall deem any payment by or on behalf of borrower hereunder that is not made in same day funds prior to 12:00 p.m. (new york city time) to be a non-conforming payment. any such payment shall not be deemed to have been received by administrative agent until the later of (i)the time such funds become available funds, and (ii)the next succeeding business day. administrative agent shall give prompt telephonic notice to borrower and each applicable lender (confirmed in writing) if any payment is non-conforming. any non-conforming payment may constitute or become a default or event of default in accordance with the terms of section8.1(a). interest shall continue to accrue on any principal as to which a non-conforming payment is made until such funds become available funds (but in no event less than the period from the date of such payment to the next succeeding applicable business day) at the rate determined pursuant to section2.10 from the date such amount was due and payable until the date such amount is paid in full. (h)if an event of default shall have occurred and not otherwise been waived, and the maturity of the obligations shall have been accelerated pursuant to section8.1, all payments or proceeds received by agents hereunder in respect of any of the obligations, shall be applied in accordance with the application arrangements described in section9.2 of the second amended and restated pledge and security agreement and the analogous sections of any other collateral documents. 2.17ratable sharing. lenders hereby agree among themselves that, except as otherwise provided in the collateral documents with respect to amounts realized from the exercise of rights with respect to liens on the collateral, if any of them shall, whether by voluntary payment (other than a voluntary prepayment of loans made and applied in accordance with the terms hereof), through the exercise of any right of set-off, consolidation or bankers lien, by counterclaim or cross action or by the enforcement of any right under the credit documents or otherwise, or as adequate protection of a deposit treated as cash collateral under any insolvency laws, receive payment or reduction of a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal, interest, amounts payable in respect of letters of credit, fees and other amounts then due and owing to such lender hereunder or under the other credit documents (collectively, the aggregate amounts due to such lender) which is greater than the proportion received by any other lender in respect of the aggregate amounts due to such other lender, then the lender receiving such proportionately greater payment shall (a)notify administrative agent and each other lender of the receipt of such payment and (b)apply a portion of such payment to purchase participations (which it shall be deemed to have purchased from each seller of a participation simultaneously upon the receipt by such seller of its portion of such payment) in the aggregate amounts due to the other lenders so that all such recoveries of aggregate amounts due shall be shared by all lenders in proportion to the aggregate amounts due to them; provided that, if all or part of such proportionately greater payment received by such purchasing lender is thereafter recovered from such lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of borrower or otherwise, those purchases shall be rescinded and the purchase prices paid for such participations shall be returned to such purchasing lender ratably to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangement and agrees that any holder of a participation so purchased may exercise any and  -72- all rights of bankers lien, consolidation, set-off or counterclaim with respect to any and all monies owing by borrower to that holder with respect thereto as fully as if that holder were owed the amount of the participation held by that holder. the provisions of this section2.17 shall not be construed to apply to (a)any payment made by borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this agreement or (b)any payment obtained by any lender as consideration for the assignment or sale of a participation in any of its loans or other obligations owed to it in accordance herewith. 2.18making or maintaining eurodollar rate loans. (a) inability to determine applicable interest rate. in the event that administrative agent shall have determined (which determination shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error), on any interest rate determination date with respect to any eurodollar rate loans, that by reason of circumstances affecting the london interbank market, adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the interest rate applicable to such loans on the basis provided for in the definition of adjusted eurodollar rate for any requested interest period with respect to a proposed eurodollar rate loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such lenders of funding such loan, administrative agent shall on such date give notice (by email or by telephone confirmed in writing) to borrower and each lender of such determination, whereupon (i)no loans may be made as, or converted to, eurodollar rate loans until such time as administrative agent notifies borrower and lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, and (ii)any funding notice or conversion/continuation notice given by borrower with respect to the loans in respect of which such determination was made shall be deemed to be rescinded by borrower. (b) illegality or impracticability of eurodollar rate loans. in the event that on any date any lender shall have determined (which determination shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error) that the making, maintaining or continuation of its eurodollar rate loans (i)has become unlawful as a result of compliance by such lender in good faith with any law, treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or would conflict with any such treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order not having the force of law even though the failure to comply therewith would not be unlawful), or (ii)has become impracticable, as a result of contingencies occurring after the date hereof which materially and adversely affect the london interbank market or the position of such lender in that market, then, and in any such event, such lender shall be an affected lender and it shall on that day give notice (by email or by telephone confirmed in writing) to borrower and administrative agent of such determination (which notice administrative agent shall promptly transmit to each other lender). if the administrative agent receives a notice from (x)any lender pursuant to clause (i)of the preceding sentence or (y)a notice from lenders constituting requisite lenders pursuant to clause (ii)of the preceding sentence, then (1)the obligation of the lenders (or, in the case of any notice pursuant to clause (i)of the preceding sentence, such lender) to make loans as, or to convert loans to, eurodollar rate loans shall be suspended until such notice shall be withdrawn by each affected lender, (2)to the extent such determination by the affected lender relates to a eurodollar rate loan then being requested by borrower pursuant to a funding notice or a conversion/continuation notice, lenders (or in the case of any notice pursuant to clause (i)of the preceding sentence, such lender) shall make such loan as (or continue such loan as or convert such loan to, as the case may be) a base rate loan, (3)the lenders (or in the case of any notice pursuant to clause (i)of the preceding sentence, such lenders) obligations to maintain their respective outstanding eurodollar rate loans (the affected loans), shall be terminated at the earlier to occur of the expiration of the interest period then in effect with respect to the affected loans or when required by law, and (4)the affected loans shall automatically convert into base rate loans on the date of such termination. notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent a determination by an affected lender as described above relates to a eurodollar rate loan then being requested by borrower pursuant to a funding notice or a conversion/continuation notice, borrower shall have the option, subject to the provisions of section2.18(c), to rescind such funding notice or conversion/continuation notice as to all lenders by giving written or telephonic notice (promptly confirmed by delivery of written notice thereof) to administrative agent of such rescission on the date on which the affected lender gives notice of its determination as described above (which notice of rescission administrative agent shall promptly transmit to each other lender). (c) compensation for breakage or non-commencement of interest periods. borrower shall compensate each lender, as promptly as practicable after written request by such lender (which request shall set forth the basis for requesting such amounts and shall be conclusive absent manifest error), for all reasonable losses, expenses and liabilities (including any interest paid or calculated to be due and payable by such lender to lenders of  -73- funds borrowed by it to make or carry its eurodollar rate loans and any loss, expense or liability sustained by such lender in connection with the liquidation or deployment of such funds but excluding loss of anticipated profits) which such lender may sustain: (i)if for any reason (other than a default by such lender) a borrowing of any eurodollar rate loan does not occur on a date specified therefor in a funding notice or a telephonic request for borrowing, or a conversion to or continuation of any eurodollar rate loan does not occur on a date specified therefor in a conversion/continuation notice or a telephonic request for conversion or continuation; (ii)if any prepayment or other principal payment of, or any conversion of, any of its eurodollar rate loans occurs on a date prior to the last day of an interest period applicable to that loan; or (iii)if any prepayment of any of its eurodollar rate loans is not made on any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by borrower. (d)booking of eurodollar rate loans. any lender may make, carry or transfer eurodollar rate loans at, to, or for the account of any of its branch offices or the office of an affiliate of such lender. (e)assumptions concerning funding of eurodollar rate loans. calculation of all amounts payable to a lender under this section2.18 and under section2.19 shall be made as though such lender had actually funded each of its relevant eurodollar rate loans a matching deposit or other borrowing in the offshore interbank market for such currency for a comparable amount and for a comparable period through the transfer of such matching deposit or other borrowing from an offshore office of such lender to a domestic office of such lender in the united states of america; provided, however, each lender may fund each of its eurodollar rate loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumptions shall be utilized only for the purposes of calculating amounts payable under this section2.18 and under section2.19. 2.19increased costs; capital adequacy. (a)compensation for increased costs and taxes. in the event that any lender (which term shall include issuing bank for purposes of this section2.19(a)) shall reasonably determine (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) that any applicable law, or any change therein or in the interpretation, administration or application thereof (including the introduction of any new applicable law), or any determination of any governmental authority, in each case that becomes effective after the date hereof, or compliance by such lender with any guideline, request or directive issued or made after the date hereof by any governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law): (i)subjects such lender (or its applicable lending office) to any additional tax (other than any excluded taxes (including any change in the rate of excluded taxes), indemnified taxes or other taxes indemnified under section2.20) with respect to this agreement or any of the other credit documents or any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder or any payments to such lender (or its applicable lending office) of principal, interest, fees or any other amount payable hereunder; (ii)imposes, modifies or holds applicable any reserve (including any marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other reserve), special deposit, compulsory loan, fdic insurance or similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, or advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such lender (other than any such reserve or other requirements with respect to eurodollar rate loans that are reflected in the definition of adjusted eurodollar rate); or (iii)imposes any other condition, cost or expense (other than with respect to a tax matter) on or affecting such lender (or its applicable lending office) or its obligations hereunder or the london interbank market and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such lender of agreeing to make, making or maintaining loans hereunder or to reduce any amount received or receivable by such lender (or its applicable lending office) with respect thereto; provided that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (x)the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (y)all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the bank for international settlements, the basel committee on banking supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the united states regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to basel iii, shall in each case be deemed a change of law, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued; then, in any such case, borrower shall pay to such lender, as promptly as practicable after receipt of the statement referred to in the next sentence, such additional amount or amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such lender in its sole discretion shall determine) as may be necessary to compensate such lender for any such increased cost or reduction in amounts received or receivable hereunder. such lender shall deliver to borrower (with a copy to administrative agent) a written statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating the additional amounts owed to such lender under this section2.19(a), which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error.  -74- (b)capital adequacy adjustment. in the event that any lender (which term shall include issuing bank for purposes of this section2.19(b)) shall have reasonably determined that the adoption, effectiveness, phase in or applicability after the third restatement date of any applicable law regarding capital or liquidity adequacy, reserve requirements or similar requirements, or any change therein or in the interpretation, application or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any lender (or its applicable lending office) with any applicable law regarding capital or liquidity adequacy, reserve requirements or similar requirements (whether or not having the force of law) of any such governmental authority, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such lender or any corporation controlling such lender as a consequence of, or with reference to, such lenders loans or revolving commitments or letters of credit, or participations therein or other obligations hereunder with respect to the loans or the letters of credit to a level below that which such lender or such controlling corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, phase in, applicability, change or compliance (taking into consideration the policies of such lender or such controlling corporation with regard to capital adequacy); provided that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (x)the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (y)all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the bank for international settlements, the basel committee on banking supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the united states regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to basel iii, shall in each case be deemed a change of law, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued, then from time to time, within five business days after receipt by borrower from such lender of the statement referred to in the next sentence, borrower shall pay to such lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such lender or such controlling corporation on an after tax basis for such reduction. such lender shall deliver to borrower (with a copy to administrative agent) a written statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating the additional amounts owed to lender under this section2.19(b), which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error. 2.20taxes; withholding, etc. (a)payments to be free and clear. all sums payable by or on behalf of any credit party hereunder and under the other credit documents shall (except to the extent required by law) be paid free and clear of, and without any deduction or withholding on account of, any tax. (b)withholding of taxes. if any credit party or any other applicable withholding agent is required by law to make any deduction or withholding on account of any indemnified taxes or other taxes from any sum paid or payable by any credit party to any agent or any lender (which term shall include each swing line lender and issuing bank for purposes of this section2.20) under any of the credit documents: (i)borrower shall notify administrative agent of any such requirement or any change in any such requirement as soon as borrower becomes aware of it; (ii)the applicable withholding agent shall make such deduction or withholding and pay such indemnified taxes or other taxes before the date on which penalties attach thereto, such payment to be made (if the liability to pay is imposed on any credit party) for its own account or (if that liability is imposed on administrative agent or such lender, as the case may be) on behalf of and in the name of administrative agent or such lender; (iii)the sum payable by the credit party in respect of which the relevant deduction, withholding or payment is required shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of that deduction, withholding or payment (including any deduction, withholding or payment applicable to additional amounts payable under this section2.20), administrative agent or such lender, as the case may be, receives on the due date a net sum equal to what it would have received had no such deduction, withholding or payment been required or made; and (iv)within thirty days after paying any sum from which it is required by law to make any deduction or withholding, and within thirty days after the due date of payment of any indemnified taxes or other taxes which it is required by clause (ii)above to pay, borrower (if borrower is the withholding agent) shall deliver to administrative agent evidence reasonably satisfactory to the other affected parties of such deduction, withholding or payment and of the remittance thereof to the relevant taxing or other authority. (c)borrower agrees to indemnify each agent and each lender for (i)the full amount of indemnified taxes and other taxes (including any indemnified taxes or other taxes attributable to any amounts payable under this section2.20) payable by such agent or such lender (whether or not such taxes are correctly or legally imposed) and (ii)any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto. a certificate from the relevant lender or agent, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis and calculation of such taxes shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  -75- (d)evidence of exemption from withholding tax. each lender shall, at such times as are reasonably requested by borrower or the administrative agent, provide borrower and the administrative agent with any documentation prescribed by law or reasonably requested by borrower or administrative agent certifying as to any entitlement of such lender to an exemption from, or reduction in, withholding tax with respect to any payments to be made to such lender under the credit documents. each lender shall, whenever a lapse in time or change in such lenders circumstances renders such documentation obsolete, expired or inaccurate in any material respect, deliver promptly to borrower and the administrative agent updated or other appropriate documentation (including any new documentation reasonably requested by the applicable withholding agent) or promptly notify borrower and the administrative agent of its inability to do so. notwithstanding anything to the contrary, a lender shall be required to provide any documentation under this section2.20(d) only to the extent it is legally eligible to do so.
