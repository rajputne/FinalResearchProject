(statements), the words you and your refer to all persons named on the credit account we issue or who have signed application or acceptance forms, and the words we, us and our refer to webbank. your promise to pay. you promise to pay for (a)credit extended by webbank to you or anyone you allow to use your account; (b)interest charges, late fees, and all other charges provided in this agreement or

joint account, all joint account holders promise to pay and be jointly and individually responsible for all amounts due under this agreement. available credit. we will assign you a credit limit, and we will indicate your current credit limit on each statement. you agree not to exceed the credit limit that we establish for you. if you request a transaction that would exceed the credit limit, we may decline it or we may allow the transaction without increasing your credit limit. you will be obligated to pay any amount in excess of your credit limit in accordance with the terms of this agreement. we may increase or reduce your credit limit, or suspend or terminate your account, at any time with or without cause. we will provide notice to you to the extent required by applicable law. statements. we will send you a statement covering each billing cycle in which you have a balance [including deferred balances, if applicable), or if required by law. billing cycles are approximately one month long. each statement will reflect: (a)the total amount you owed on the first day of your billing cycle (called the previous balance), which will include any deferred balance (see below under the heading deferral periods); (b)payments, credits, purchases and interest charges, and all other charges made to your account during the billing cycle; (c)the total amount you owed at the end of the billing cycle (called new balance); (d)the minimum payment you must make (called the minimum payment); and (e)the date by which the minimum payment must be paid to avoid a late charge. account plans. your account offers you two payment plans for purchases: the easy option standard plan and the fast option promotional plan. each time you make a purchase, you will choose the plan to which your purchase should be added. your minimum payment amount and your interest charges are different for the two plans. payments. each month, your minimum payment is due by the date set forth on the statement, which will be at least 24days from the statement date. your payment due date will always be the same date each month. you may pay more than the minimum payment, up to the entire new balance, at any time. calculating your minimum payment. your minimum payment each month will be the combined total of your easy option minimum payment amount and the fast option minimum payment amount, plus any amount that is past due.   easy option. your easy option minimum payment amount is determined by the purchases and balances on the easy option plan. when you make a purchase using the easy option plan, if you do not already have an outstanding easy option plan balance, then your easy option minimum payment amount will be equal to 5.5% of the original purchase price or $20.00, whichever is greater at the time of purchase. this minimum payment amount will remain fixed until any one of the following events occurs: (a)any return is posted to your easy option plan; (b)a new purchase is added to your easy option plan. when any of these events occurs, we will recalculate the easy option minimum payment amount to be equal to 5.5% of the easy option balance or $20.00, whichever is greater at the time of our recalculation. when your payments reduce your easy option balance to $0, then the easy option minimum payment due will be equal to $0. fast option. when you make a purchase using the fast option plan, we will tell you the minimum payment for that purchase, which is calculated to allow you to pay for the purchase and related interest charges by making four equal monthly payments. if you make late payments or pay less than the required minimum payment, then you may be required to make additional payments for your fast option purchases. because each purchase you make on the fast option plan has a separately calculated minimum payment, your total fast option minimum payment due is equal to the sum of the minimum payments for each of your purchases made using the fast option plan. after the first four payments for a purchase, the minimum payment for that purchase will be equal to any unpaid amount of that purchase and any interest charges on

figure periodic interest charges. we figure your total periodic interest charges each month by adding together the interest charges applicable to your easy option plan and the interest charges applicable to your fast option plan. we will also add any deferred interest charges in connection with deferred interest promotions, if applicable. if the total periodic interest charges for a month are les s than $0.50 then we charge a minimum periodic interest charge of $0.50 which we will apply to the applicable balance.   determining the interest charge on your easy option plan and your fast option plan. to determine the amount of interest charges applicable to each of the easy option plan and the fast option plan, we multiply the average daily balance for each plan times the monthly periodic rate for that plan. average daily balance. to get the average daily balance for each of the easy option and fast option plans, we take the beginning balance of that plan of your account each day, add any new purchases on the plan that day, and subtract any payments or credits we apply to the plan that day. we add interest charges to each feature on a monthly basis. we add other charges and fees, such as late fees, to the easy option plan on the day that such charges or fees are posted to the account. if your account has an overall credit balance, we treat this as a $0 balance. this gives us the daily balance for each plan. then we add up all the daily balances for each plan for each day in the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. this gives us the average daily balance for each plan. monthly periodic rate. we determine the monthly periodic rate as follows:  for your easy option plan, an annual percentage rate (or apr) of 19.90% (corresponding monthly periodic rate 1.658%) applies to your easy option plan balances and purchases during the easy option period. this is a non-variable rate.  for your fast option plan, an annual percentage rate (or apr) of 14.90% (corresponding monthly periodic rate 1.242%) applies to each purchase during the fast option period. this is a non-variable rate. the amount of periodic interest charges and aprs are subject to change. see below under the heading change of terms (including interest charges). when interest charges begin to accrue. interest charges begin to accrue on each purchase on the date of the purchase. however, if you paid the new balance on your previous statement by the payment due date shown on that statement, then: (1)if you pay the new balance on your current billing statement by the payment due date shown, we impose no interest charges on purchases during the current billing cycle, and (2)if you make a payment by the payment due date shown on your current statement that is less than the new balance, we will credit that payment as of the first day in your current billing cycle. in addition, if your previous statement reflected a new balance and you did not pay that new balance in full by the payment due date on that previous statement, then we will not impose interest charges on any purchases during the current billing cycle if you pay the new balance shown on your current statement by the payment due date reflected on that current statement. deferral periods. from time to time, we may offer you the opportunity to enter into promotions. terms of these promotions will be provided in connection with any offers. late fees. late fees will be equal to your minimum payment due with a maximum amount of up to $25.00 for the first time

payment due to which the late fee relates. returned payment fees. returned payment fees will be equal to your minimum payment with a maximum amount of up to $25.00 for the first time offense and will increase to a maximum amount of $30.00 if you have any returned payments in your next 6 billing cycles. the returned payment fee will never be greater than your most recent minimum payment due.   application of payments. each payment you send to us will be applied to your account in a manner consistent with applicable law. generally, we will apply your payment first to satisfy all minimum payments due for your easy option and fast option plans. change of terms (including interest charges). subject to applicable law, we may change or terminate any term of this agreement or add new terms

compliance policy section13.1 customer identification program policy statement it is the policy of bluestem brands, inc (bluestem) to insure proper adherence section326 of the usa patriot act regarding the requirement to implement reasonable procedures to verify the identity of any person seeking to open a credit account, maintain records of the information used to verify the persons identity, including name, address and other identifying information, and determine whether the person appears on any lists of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations provided by a government agency and to bluestem by its partner banks. the provisions and intent of the usa patriot act require bluestem and its partner banks to implement and maintain identification, documentation, verification, and recordkeeping procedures to ensure: i. compliance with state and federal laws and regulations; ii. adherence to safe and sound banking practices; iii. decrease risk that bluestem and/or its partner banks will become victim to illegal activities; and iv. protect the reputation and strategic position of bluestem and its partner banks. risk management bluestem, as part of its overall risk management program, reviews each area where risks may present themselves to regulatory customer identification requirements. customer due diligence the usa patriot act establishes minimum standards regarding the identity of any customer who applies to open a new credit account. specifically, financial institutions must: identify and verify all persons seeking to open a new credit account; maintain accurate records of such; and compare presented customer identification with government lists. bluestems procedures for verifying the true identity of a person are based on bluestem and its partner banks risk assessment presented by the type of account, the various methods of opening an account, and the type of identifying information available. in any instance, though, employees must ensure that a reasonable belief of the true identity of bluestem customers is obtained. 1  identification information required before opening a new credit account includes all of the following: name; date of birth; physical/street address, includes: a. army post office (apo)or fleet post office (fpo)box number; or b. physical/street address where they can be reached and mail sent to; 4. social security number. procedures for verification of identity for a customer submitting an application in person an unexpired identification which provides evidence of a customers nationality or residence and bears a photograph or similar safeguard, such as a drivers license or passport. for customers submitting applications over the phone, through direct mail or over the internet, the applicants identification must be validated by comparing the information provided with information received from a credit reporting agency, public database or other source. in the event that the information cannot be verified through a credit reporting agency, before opening a new credit account, a persons identity must be verified through one or more of the following documentary and non-documentary methods: unexpired government issued identification; verification through a public database; utility bill with the persons name and address the specific step by step verification procedures for handing the verification of a persons information when it cannot be verified through a credit reporting agency are outlined and maintained on the consumer credit compliance program intranet site. management of the department with responsibility for account opening is responsible for ensuring their employees are properly trained and adhere to these procedures. procedures for lack of identity verification it is against policy to open or maintain a credit account for a person if the person cannot be properly validated and a reasonable belief is not formed of the true identity of the person. if a persons identity cannot be verified within specific timeframes provided for in operational procedures, the person is to be notified in writing and the persons credit application declined. note: on a case by case basis, in the event of a suspicious situation where a persons identity cannot be properly verified, a sar may need to be filed. if this is the case, the compliance manager should be contacted for guidance and assistance. the compliance manager will subsequently notify the partner bank to report the suspicious activity so the partner bank can determine whether the filing of a sar is necessary. additional account opening procedures in addition to those listed in this policy, it may be necessary to conduct additional information verification procedures to re-verify the true identity of a customer or the true purpose of a credit 2  account. in this instance, the compliance manager should be contacted for guidance and assistance. procedures for comparing with government lists it is bluestems practice, during the customer identification verification process, to determine whether a person appears on any list of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations or any known or suspected drug traffickers or drug trafficking organizations provided by a government agency or by our partner banks. these lists include, but are not limited to, the of ac and 314(a) lists. please also see the bluestem brands, inc credit compliance policy section11ofac policy and the bluestem brands, inc credit compliance policy section12-fincen 314(a) list policy. customer notice procedures it is bluestems policy to provide consumers with adequate notice that a partner bank is requesting information to verify their identity. such notice will be provided to consumers in applicable account disclosures on all direct mail solicitations or electronically via a website. the notices state; important information about procedures for opening a new account: to help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. what this means to you: when you open an account, we will ask you for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. we may also ask to see your drivers license or other identifying documents. recordkeeping it is bluestems policy to retain the following documentation related to the identity verification of customers for a period of 60months from the date a credit account is closed or become dormant: all identifying information provided by a customer after the date the account is closed or becomes dormant; a description of any document that was relied upon pursuant to this policy that clearly evidences the type of document and identification number it may contain; a description of the methods and results of any measures undertaken to verify the identity of a customer pursuant to this policy; and a description of the resolution of any substantive discrepancy discovered when verifying the identifying information obtained. 3  viii. staff training general it is the responsibility of the appropriate department to ensure that employees receive appropriate training on the customer identification program and the directives of this policy. all managers are responsible for the complete comprehension of this policy and for verifying their employees understand their responsibilities, the compliance manager and/or other designated member of management will periodically attend educational programs related to bsa and cip. 5. if, at any time, an employee is uncertain about the proper handling of a situation or transaction, he or she should refer the issue to their immediate supervisor or contact the compliance manager for further guidance. procedures: operational procedures

administrator for webbank (webbank) during underwriting, origination, and servicing phases of the webbank/gettington credit program. the consumer credit compliance program was developed and implemented by bluestem to further compliance with laws applicable to the revolving credit program. the program is designed to further compliance with the law or regulations named in the applicable policy, to wit:  regulationz/truth in lending (12 cfr 226)  regulationb/equal credit opportunity act (12 cfr 202) fair credit reporting act/facta (12 cfr 222 and 15 usc 1681 seq.) bank secrecy act/usa patriot act (31 cfr 103 and hr 3162) right to financial privacy (12 usc 3501) servicemembers civil relief act fair debt collection practices act gramm-leach-bliley privacy act (12 cfr 332) ftc unfair and deceptive practices act (16 cfr 444) the consumer credit compliance program encompasses the lending activities of webbank for which bluestem acts as administrator. monitors are in place across all functional areas of the company which include a credit component, be it prescreening, underwriting, servicing or collections. bluestems legal services department monitors changes in applicable laws and regulations, engaging nationally recognized financial services counsel as partners in this effort, and ensures that such changes are reflected in the applicable policies and procedures. consumer credit compliance program bluestems consumer credit compliance program steering committee has been authorized by bluestems executive team to provide oversight of the development and administration of the compliance program. operating teams from the four main functional areas which include credit components (customer service, credit operations, credit risk and collections) have day-to-day responsibility for maintaining compliance with internal procedures and monitoring of same. 1  exhibit i bluestems compliance program is maintained in a written format and is housed on the companys internal sharepoint system. access to policies and procedures is available to all employees who require it in order to fulfill their responsibilities under the program. monitoring of compliance procedures is incorporated in the normal business activities of each affected area and reported upon monthly. goals for the monitoring process include the detection of procedural or training deficiencies and the application of corrective action plans where appropriate. training understanding of the laws which guide the various procedures across the company is an integral part of bluestems new hire training. in addition, specialized training is provided to staff who perform functions that are guided by consumer compliance laws, such as billing disputes or collections. compliance procedure overview bluestem has adopted policies and procedures as an integral part of its consumer credit compliance program. the policies are listed in this document under the heading compliance program overview. this section of the document is intended to be illustrative in a summary fashion of certain procedures also constituting part of the consumer credit compliance program. it is only representative of certain of bluestems procedures and therefore is not a comprehensive index of procedures nor the procedures themselves. collections collections support settlement procedure a customer may be offered a settlement if his or her account is two or more cycles past due (66days or greater excluding charged-off accounts) and the account falls into certain pre-determined behavior score ranges. the last payment must be received within 60days of the first payment. the offer is null and void if payments are not received or are returned by a financial institution as unpaid. the account will not be moved to a settlement status until 30days after the last payment is received. 2  exhibit i cease and desist requests when a written request is received via mail from the customer, an attorney representing the customer or any third party who provides a power of attorney signed by the customer, communications from bluestem regarding the collection of an account will cease within 48 hours. reduced payment plans bluestem offers reduced payment plans to customers who experience financial hardships. a qualifying payment is a minimum of 2.5% of the account balance. late fees are not applied while the customer is on the program and the interest charges are reduced. reage of accounts customers who are at least 66days past due and have no open to buy are eligible for bluestems reage program. customers are offered a reage program when they are unable to bring their accounts current through any other means. when on a reage program, the customer must make three qualifying payments in order for the account to reage. an account may only be reaged if it is at least nine months old, and may be reaged only once in a 12-month period and no more than twice in a five-year period. bankruptcy and deceased early charge-off accounts marked as bankruptcy or deceased will be charged off 60days after notification, provided there is a balance and the account is six or more days delinquent. consumer credit counseling services (cccs)from time to time, customers who are facing financial difficulties will contract with a consumer credit counseling service (cccs) in an effort to pay their debt. cccs companies contact bluestem with a written proposal for repayment. the payment amount proposed must be at least 2.5% of the outstanding balance or $15.00, whichever is greater, in order to be accepted. if the account is less than 90days delinquent, the apr is set at 14.90% and the account is set to cccs retention. if the account is greater than 90days delinquent, the apr is sent at 9.90% and the account is set to cccs closed. 3  exhibit i credit operations fincen reporting the financial crimes enforcement network (fincen) provides biweekly files containing names and addresses (when available) of individuals and businesses appearing on specially designated terrorist lists. bluestem matches the names of individuals against the lists of current credit customers; in the event a name is a match or a potential match, further investigation is completed and the results of the investigation is forwarded to the account-owning bank. when a match occurs, the results are grouped based on three main matching criteria: a one-to-one match on ssn, a one-to-one match by alias first name/last name, city and zip code, or a calculated match by address and city. manual review override authorization from time to time, requests are made for credit line increases that are outside the normal parameters for the manual review area. in such cases, the request is forwarded to a supervisor or manager. manual review supervisors have the authority up to $200.00 to approve an account or increase of a credit limit. manual review managers have authority up to $500.00 to approve an account or increase of a credit limit. the director/vice president of nca has authority up to $2000.00 to approve an account or increase of a credit limit. requests for amounts greater than $2000.00 are referred to the head of risk management. credit risk modeling variable restrictions the following attributes are not to be included in the development or usage of any credit statistical models: age, gender, religion, language preference, nationality, state of residence (or any other fields that could directly or indirectly cause redlining), marital status or medical condition. all credit statistical models will be reviewed by the model review committee. glb annual notifications on an annual basis (defined as within a 12-month period), privacy notices are provided to all account holders required to receive such notices. account holders exempt from notification include all zero balance closed accounts, charged off/closed, bankrupt and deceased accounts. account holders are provided the right and the ability to opt out of information sharing and are provided a form and mailing address on the privacy notification. 4  exhibit i credit bureau reporting on behalf of the account-owning bank, bluestem reports information on its credit accounts on a monthly basis to both equifax and transunion. the extract file developed for reporting purposes conforms to the standard metro 2 credit reporting format. customer service and collections support have separate operational procedures in order to comply with reporting requirements and any subsequent customer inquiries. collections support is responsible for handling all customer disputes. portfolio reviews on a quarterly basis, bluestem, on behalf of the account-owning bank, obtains an updated read on the credit bureau attributes of selected accounts. a representative of the credit risk team runs a sas program to determine which customers satisfy the criteria in place to generate a review. this group of customers is then compared to a file constructed by it using the same criteria, and if the comparison is acceptable, the file is sent to the credit bureau. upon receipt of the updated information for the reviewed customers, credit risk verifies that the customers returned are the same as those sent out and that the attributes returned are reasonable. real time authorizations this fully automated process provides guidelines and logic for making purchase authorization decisions at the point of sale. it includes decisioning for overlimit authorizations and high risk declines. at each purchase attempt, accounts satisfying all other criteria to approve the purchase except sufficient available credit are subject to otb logic, which uses preset parameters to make an authorization decision. if the purchase passes the otb logic, the authorization is approved. no overlimit fees are assessed. if the purchase does not pass the otb logic, the authorization is declined. in addition, at each purchase attempt, accounts satisfying all other criteria that would approve the purchase are analyzed in real time to assess the risk of the purchase. if the purchase meets the high-end threshold in terms of defining the risk the account will become seriously delinquent within the next 12months, the purchase authorization is declined and the credit limit is reduced to balance. the customer is sent an adverse action letter which provides the reasons for the declination. 5  exhibit i credit line increase program on a monthly basis, bluestem, on behalf of the account owning bank, executes an automated credit limit increase program for accounts with demonstrated payment capacity and low risk. the credit limit increase program is not run in january or july so as not to interfere with the portfolio review process. the credit limit increase process utilizes three unique sets of logic to determine which accounts qualify. two types of increases are given to customers: permanent and temporary. temporary line increases generally have an expiration date of 90days. however, if a customer utilizes all or part of the temporary line increase, their limit will remain increased by the amount of the utilization even after the expiration date. credit line decrease due to delinquency at the end of each billing cycle, accounts meeting pre-set conditions are systematically reviewed for a decrease in the credit limit. with the conditions met, actions are taken based upon the number of days delinquent. limits on accounts with a 60-89day delinquency status are reduced to balance and rounded up to the nearest whole dollar. the credit limit will not be reduced below $100.00. limits on accounts with a 90+ day delinquency status are reduced to zero. no action is taken for purposes of this procedure on accounts that are less than 60days delinquent. customer service billing disputes in the event a customer has a dispute as defined in the truth-in-lending act and notifies bluestem no later than 60days after the first billing statement on which the disputed information appears, bluestem will investigate and resolve the dispute on behalf of webbank within the timeframes as specified in the truth-in-lending act. during the period in which the dispute is being investigated, the amount in dispute will be suspended from the accrual of interest charges, billing, and, in some cases, collection. all notification to the customer regarding the receipt, investigation and resolution of the dispute will be sent within the timeframes as specified in the truth-in-lending act. 6  exhibit i servicemembers civil relief act upon the request of a customer who is enlisted in the armed services (as defined by the scra), and when accompanied by copies of the customers active duty orders, bluestem will reduce the interest rate to 6% on that portion of the account balance incurred prior to the customers call to active duty. within 30-60days prior to the release of the customer from active duty, bluestem will send notification to the customer that their protection under scra is due to expire and request further documentation in the event the customers active duty has been extended. protection under the scra will terminate within 30-60days of the customers discharge from active duty. as a courtesy to customers on active duty, and upon appropriate verification, bluestem will accept requests for protection and information regarding deployment from a servicemembers spouse. 7  inhibit j third-party service contractors in accordance with and subject to section39 of the agreement and section12 of the receivables sale agreement, companys tier 1 and tier 2 subcontractors are as follows: tier 1: the tier 1 subcontractors include corecard software, inc. and experian marketing solutions, which entities provide company with its card processing platform and application approval system, respectively. tier 2: the tier 2 subcontractors include, without limitation, allianceone, inc. and nco financial services, inc., which entities provide first-party collection support to company, and vcustomer corporation and 24-7 customer, inc., which entities provide customer servicing support to company, including account application and servicing.   exhibit k bluestem brands, inc credit compliance policy section42 bank secrecy act i. purpose the bank secrecy act (bsa)and related laws and regulations require financial institutions and their servicers to take reasonable steps to verify the identity of their customers, monitor and report certain currency, suspicious and foreign transactions, and maintain specific records. these steps require financial institutions to keep records that provide documentation that law enforcement can utilize and provide penalties for individuals and entities attempting to avoid these requirements. ii. policy description, authority and scope description and authority this policy is a general statement of bluestem brands, incs (bluestem) objectives, direction and expectations regarding the bsa. as such, it is the authority, basis and platform for the development, communication, implementation, interpretation and enforcement of appropriate and applicable operating procedures. it is the policy of bluestem to comply with all provisions of the bsa. all employees must comply with this policy and all steps necessary are taken to ensure that proper adherence to the laws and regulations can be met. enforcement changes to this policy require approval by the consumer credit compliance steering committee. changes in operating procedures, standards, guidelines, and technologies, provided they are consistent with this policy, may be authorized by the consumer credit compliance operating team for the affected department and its representative on the consumer credit compliance steering committee and the compliance manager. the consumer credit compliance steering committee will approve this policy annually. it is responsible for ensuring the directives are implemented and administered in compliance with the approved policy. the primary responsibility for enforcement of this policy and its operating procedures rests with bluestem employees. 1  no part of this policy or its supporting operating procedures should be interpreted as contravening or superseding any other legal and regulatory requirements. protective measures should not impede other legally mandated processes such as records retention or subpoenas. any conflicts should immediately be submitted to the compliance manager for further evaluation and/or subsequent submission to the consumer credit compliance steering committee. exceptions to policy there are no exceptions to the bluestem bsa policy. if unique circumstances exist that may require special handling, requests for this special handling must be very specific and apply only to specific terms or items, rather than entire sections of the policy. employees with special handling requests are to communicate their requests by submitting them in writing to the compliance manager for consideration by the consumer credit compliance steering committee and/or senior management. iii. risk management general bluestem realizes that the potential for risk exists in an ever changing environment, and in response, has developed and implemented this comprehensive risk-based bsa, anti-money laundering (aml) program. this program is designed to mitigate risks associated with bluestems partner banks and the geographies, customers, products, services, and the nature of bluestems operations. this program provides for policies and procedures, and the assignment of designated employees responsible for monitoring day to day compliance. the nature of the business conducted by bluestem does not generally provide exposure to a high risk of bsa or aml issues and past history demonstrates that bluestem has a low risk of bsa or aml violations. nevertheless, bluestem has committed to establishing strong internal controls, processes, policies, and procedures to maintain compliance in all areas. iv. currency transaction reporting general federal law and regulation requires financial institutions to report every cash transaction by a customer (unless the customer is specifically exempted) in excess of $10,000 to the internal revenue service on a currency transaction report within 15days of the transaction. however, since it is the policy of bluestem to not accept any cash payments, this requirement is not relevant to bluestems business. if at any time bluestem receives an unsolicited cash payment, the payment is to be reported to the payment processing manager, who is then required to report the cash payment to the compliance manager. v. report of crimes and suspected crimes general the fdics rules and regulations require insured banks to make prompt and systematic reports of crimes and attempted crimes to law enforcement authorities. this responsibility covers any known, attempted, or suspected crimes involving or affecting the assets or affairs of insured banks. as a servicer on behalf of bluestems partner banks, it is the policy of bluestem to 2  comply with rules and regulations of the applicable regulator as required by bluestems partner banks. suspicious activity and crimes can be identified in a wide variety of forms that may indicate money laundering or other illegal activity. however, as activity may appear suspicious, it may only require enhanced scrutiny. examples of activity that may require enhanced scrutiny include, but are not limited to: activity inconsistent with a customers prior history; unusual characteristics of a customer; unusual or inconsistent payment activity unusual or inconsistent account purchase activity; or a consumer provides inconsistent, incomplete, insufficient or suspicious information when requested to comply with the information requirements of bluestems customer identification program, (see credit compliance policy section13, customer identification program) examples of suspicious activity that must be reported include, but are not limited to: any bsa violation (ex. structuring or money laundering); bribery or gratuity; check fraud; computer intrusion; loan fraud; counterfeit credit card; counterfeit payment instrument; credit card fraud; employee defalcation or embezzlement; identity theft; misuse of position or self dealing; mysterious disappearance; terrorist financing; wire transfer fraud. suspicious activity reports the treasury departments financial crimes enforcement network (fincen), along with bank regulatory agencies, has adopted the suspicious activity report (sar). all banks are required to file a sar for any matter that they have basis to believe is a known or suspected violation of federal criminal law. as a servicer on behalf of its partner banks, it is the policy of bluestem to comply with fincen rules as required by its partner banks. examples of incidents that require a bank to file a sar include but are not limited to: known or suspected violations of federal criminal law by one of bluestems directors, officers, employees, agents or other affiliated parties that may have committed or aided in the commission of the violation; known or suspected violations of federal criminal law involving or aggregating $5000 or more and there is substantial basis for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects; 3  3. known or suspected violation of federal criminal law involving or aggregating $25,000 or more and there is no substantial basis for indentifying a possible suspect or group of suspects; transactions involving or aggregating $5000 or more that involve potential money laundering or violations of the bsa. note: bluestem will notify its partner bank in the event of a robbery or burglary, but no sar is required to be filed if the robbery or burglary is reported to the appropriate law enforcement authorities. in the event bluestem identifies a known or suspected violation of federal criminal law as described above, bluestem will immediately notify its affected partner bank so that the bank may file a sar. a sar must be filed within 30 calendar days after the date of initial detection of the facts that constitute the basis for filing a sar. if no suspect was identified on the date of detection of the incident requiring filing, the bank may delay filing the sar for an additional 30 calendar days to identify a suspect. in no case shall reporting be delayed more than 60 calendar days after the date of initial detection of a reportable incident. to the best of its ability, bluestem will provide its partner bank the following information so that the bank may file a sar: who conducted the transaction; what instrument or instruments facilitated the suspicious activity; when the suspicious activity occurred; where the suspicious activity took place; why bluestem believes the activity is suspicious; how the suspicious activity occurred; and any documentation that supports the filing of the sar. a sar is confidential. if bluestem is subpoenaed or otherwise requested to disclose any information regarding a sar or the information contained in a sar, bluestem will decline to provide any information that would disclose that a sar has been filed. any such requests should be immediately forwarded to the compliance manager for handling. bluestem will also notify its partner bank so that they may notify the appropriate regulatory agency of the request. employee reporting of suspicious activity any bluestem employee detecting a violation of federal criminal law or who has a suspicion that a violation of federal criminal law has as occurred is to report their suspicions. employees may report suspicious currency transactions or other activities to the compliance manager. the identity of the employee reporting the incident may remain anonymous. vi. anti-money laundering policy statement 4  it is the policy of bluestem to ensure proper adherence to the provisions and intent of the usa patriot act regarding the requirement to implement reasonable procedures to deter money laundering activities and actively search for suspicious activity. this policy is a general statement of bluestems objectives, direction and expectations regarding bluestems anti-money laundering (aml) programs. as such, it is the authority, basis and platform for the development, communication, implementation, interpretation and enforcement of appropriate and applicable operating procedures. changes to this policy require approval by the consumer credit compliance steering committee. changes in operating procedures, standards, guidelines and technologies, provided they are consistent with this policy, may be authorized by the consumer credit compliance operating team for the affected department and its representative on the consumer credit compliance steering committee and the compliance manager. the consumer credit compliance steering committee is responsible for ensuring the directives are implemented and administered in compliance with the policy. the primary responsibility for enforcement of this policy and its operating procedures lies with the consumer credit compliance steering committee and bluestem employees. general money laundering means any activity criminalized by 18 usc 1956 or 1957. money is laundered to conceal all types of criminal activity. it is driven by the need to conceal the true source of funds, and becomes necessary when the amount of money is so large that the criminal or criminal organization cannot reasonably absorb it into their lifestyle or business. money laundering, through often a complex process, generally consists of three independent steps that often occur at once: 1. placement. this involves illegal money in bank, in a non-bank financial institution, in the general domestic economy, or in a foreign economy. some examples of placing money are listed below. a. structuring/smurfing. this involves the structuring of cash, monetary instruments, or exchanges of small bills for larger denominations to avoid currency transaction report reporting requirements. b. bank complicity. this occurs when bank staff, from front line operational employees to executives, are bribed by criminals or when entire institutions are controlled by criminals. c. misuse of bsa exemption lists. this occurs when banks or non-bank financial institutions do not follow bsa rules for reviewing accounts and maintaining an active know your customer policy and grant exceptions from bsa reviews. d. creation of false bsa trails. this occurs when documents are falsified to disguise the true source, ownership, location or controls over illegal money. 2. layering. this means separating the illegal money from the source through layers of complex financial transactions. if the placement of money is undetected, the money laundering activities are even more difficult to uncover. the confusing complicated ways in which layer after layer of activities and transactions are piled on 5  top of one another are intended to make tracing of funds impossible to law enforcement. 3. integration. this provides an apparently legitimate explanation for the illegal money. this is the final stage in the process of money laundering where the cleansed money is integrated into the economy providing the appearance that the funds were legally obtained. risk analysis, detection and monitoring due to the nature of the business of bluestem and the programs serviced on behalf of its partner banks, bluestems customer base is considered low risk for money laundering activities. it is considered low risk because bluestem offers and services only low credit line credit cards to individual consumers, not businesses, and provide no high risk banking functions or transactions such as private banking,

intended to create a cooperative partnership between the financial community and law enforcement in order to gather information that could be relevant to significant law enforcement investigations pertaining to such criminal activities as money laundering or terrorism, and tax evasion. information requests from fincen generally are in the form of the fincen 314(a) list. by statute, fincen provides the 314(a) list directly to financial institutions, which are required to perform a one-time scan of their accounts and transactions against the list. the list is confidential and is provided biweekly. banks issuing credit on behalf of bluestem brands, inc (bluestem) then securely provide bluestem with the 314(a) list for investigation. the puipose of this policy is to ensure compliance
