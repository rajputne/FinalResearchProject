(b) notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default, if any principal of or interest on any loan or any fee or other amount payable by the borrowers hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i)in the case of overdue principal of or interest on any loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such loan as provided in paragraph (a)of this section or (ii)in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to tranche b loans as provided in paragraph (a)of this section.

(d) all interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable. (e) all interest paid or payable pursuant to this section shall be paid in jpy. section2.11 alternate rate of interest. if: (a) the administrative agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable fixed rate base rate with respect to any loan, (including the applicable screen rate referred to in the definition of the applicable fixed rate base rate not being available or ascertainable for the relevant currency on the base rate calculation date); or (b) the administrative agent is advised by the required lenders that the applicable base rate with respect to any loan will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such lenders (or lender) of making or maintaining their loans (or its loan) included in such borrowing (each of (a)and (b), a rate event); then the administrative agent shall give notice thereof to the parent and the lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter (the date of giving of such notice,  28 the rate event notice day) and, until the administrative agent notifies the parent and the lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i)any borrowing requests for new loans will be effective only if all lenders are making loans generally at such time (provided that any lender that chooses in its discretion to nonetheless extend the loan pursuant to such request, may do so in accordance with its pro rata portion) and (ii)the parent and the lenders under each applicable tranche shall promptly enter into good faith discussions (each acting reasonably) to determine and agree on a rate representing the all-in cost of funds to the applicable lenders of funding such fixed rate loans under such tranche, which rate shall then be the applicable base rate for such tranche; provided that if the parent and such lenders are not able to agree on such a rate for such tranche by 5:00 p.m. tokyo time on the date that is one business day after the rate event notice day (the rate agreement deadline), then the applicable base rate for such tranche shall be the reference bank rate, as determined below. if a rate event occurs on or prior to the draw down date, no loans shall be drawn until such time as the applicable base rates are determined in accordance herewith. the reference bank rate shall be determined as follows: if after the occurrence of a rate event the parent and the lenders do not agree upon an applicable base rate by the rate agreement deadline, the administrative agent shall promptly request each of the reference banks to supply to the administrative agent by 5:00 p.m. tokyo time on the date that is one business day after the rate agreement deadline (the submission time) the rate (including the all-in costs of fixing the applicable rate) at which that reference bank could have borrowed funds in the applicable currency of the applicable loans on a 3-month jpy libor basis and arrange for fixing the rate on such loans for a period equal to the tenor of the relevant loan of such tranche in the relevant interbank market (and relevant rate fixing market) at such time, were it to have done so by asking for and then accepting interbank offers for deposits in reasonable market size in jpy (and arranging for such rate fixing) and for a period comparable to the tenor of that loan. the administrative agent shall, with respect to each applicable tranche, take (x)the arithmetic mean of the rates provided by the submission time by the syndicate reference banks (the syndicate reference rate) and (y)the arithmetic mean of the rates provided by the benchmark reference banks (if any) (the benchmark reference rate) (in each case, rounded upwards to four decimal places), and subsequently take the arithmetic mean of the syndicate reference rate and the benchmark reference rate (with the syndicate reference rate weighing for 2/3rds of the total in the aggregate and the benchmark reference rate weighing 1/3rd of the total in the aggregate, and such arithmetic mean as so calculated (rounded upwards to four decimal places) shall at such point be the reference bank rate in respect of the applicable base rate for such tranche, it being understood that if no benchmark reference bank provides such a quote by the submission time then the reference bank rate shall be the arithmetic mean of the quotes provided by the syndicate reference banks (rounded upwards to four decimal places). as used in this agreement: benchmark reference bank means the respective primary london lending offices of each of the following (or london affiliates thereof): (i)citibank, n.a., (ii)hsbc bank plc, (iii)bnp paribas sa, (iv)deutsche bank and (v)societe generale. reference banks means collectively the syndicate reference banks and the benchmark reference banks.  29 syndicate reference bank means the respective primary london lending office of each of the following (or london affiliates thereof): (i)sumitomo mitsui banking corporation, (ii)the bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj, ltd. and (iii)mizuho bank. section2.12 increased costs.

to the date that such lender notifies the parent of the change in law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such lenders intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the change in law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. section2.13 illegality. notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, (a)if the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation shall make it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for any lender to perform its obligations hereunder or to fund any loans or (b)if as a result of any merger, consolidation, amalgamation or acquisition by or of parent or any subsidiary with, into or of another person it is or becomes unlawful due to group or company lending limitations or other similar limitations under israeli law (or rule, regulation or interpretation thereof or any rules, regulations or interpretations of the bank of israel) for any lender to perform its obligations hereunder or to fund any loans (each of clauses (a)and (b), an illegality), then (x)such lender shall promptly notify the parent upon becoming aware of that event and the commitment of such lender will be immediately cancelled and (y)each applicable borrower shall repay the loans granted to it by such lender on the last day of the interest period for each loan occurring after such lender has notified such borrower or, if earlier, the date specified by such lender in the notice delivered to such borrower (being no earlier than the last day of any applicable grace period permitted by law). section2.14 break funding payments. in the event of (a)the payment or acceleration of any principal of any loan other than on the maturity date applicable to such loan (including as a result of an event of default and including in the case of any voluntary prepayments or any of the mandatory prepayment described in section2.08 (c)and/or (d), and including without limitation any acceleration of the obligations under the loan documents), (b)the failure to borrow or prepay any loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may have been revoked), or (c)the assignment of any loan as a result of a request by any borrower pursuant to section2.17 (each of (a), (b)and (c), a break event), then, in any such event, the applicable borrower shall compensate each lender for break costs attributable to such event. promptly following receipt of a prepayment notice in accordance with section2.08 or the occurrence of an acceleration of obligations under the loan documents the administrative agent shall advise each lender of the details of such prepayment notice or the occurrence of such acceleration. each lender shall be entitled to receive from the applicable borrower any break costs attributable to such break event and shall be entitled to deliver to the administrative agent a certificate referred to below (a lender certificate) setting forth the applicable break costs that such lender is entitled to receive from the applicable borrower as a result of such break event. a lender certificate of any lender setting forth, in reasonable detail showing the computation thereof, any break costs that such lender is entitled to receive from the applicable borrower pursuant to this section delivered to the administrative agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. the applicable borrower shall pay to the administrative agent, for the account of the applicable lender, the amount shown as due on any such lender certificate by the date that is four business days after the receipt of such lender certificate by the administrative agent (in case that such receipt is after 5:00 p.m., tokyo time, such receipt shall be deemed to be done on the next business day) (it being understood that in the case of a prepayment, the applicable lender  31 may deliver such lender certificate as early as two business days prior to the date of anticipated prepayment set forth in the applicable prepayment notice); provided that in the case of an acceleration arising out of an event of default, all such break costs shall be immediately due and payable. it is understood that (x)in connection with any given break event, different lenders may have different break costs, if any, and the applicable loan party shall pay each lender its applicable break costs, if any, in accordance herewith and (y)the administrative agent shall not be obligated to make any calculations of break costs or any other amounts under this section2.14. in addition, each lender (acting individually) shall also be entitled (but not obligated) to arrange a conference call with a representative of the parent (at a time mutually convenient for the parent and such lender, each acting reasonably, on or about the day that it two business days prior to the break event) to arrange the applicable rate fixing unwind prior to the applicable prepayment date. each lender, acting severally on its own behalf (and not jointly with the administrative agent or any other lender) agrees with the loan parties that, provided that no default or event of default has occurred and is at such time continuing, the applicable borrower shall be entitled to receive from such lender (within seven business days after the date of the applicable break event) all rate fixing breakage net gains, if any, received by such lender resulting from such break event. in the event that any lender claims any rate fixing breakage costs, such lender shall act in good faith and in a commercially reasonably manner and in accordance with customary market practice in connection with making such calculation, and, to the extent the relevant rate fixing agreement was made between such lender, on the one hand, and an internal division or entity of such lender or an affiliate of such lender, on the other hand, such rate fixing agreement shall be on economic terms no less favourable in any material respect (when taken together as a whole) from the perspective of the loan parties than those that would have been obtained in a comparable rate fixing transaction (or a trade confirmation of the rate fixing, as the case may be) in respect of such loans between such lender and an unaffiliated third party, entered into on an arms-length basis on customary market terms as existing on the date entered into. if at any point prior to the final maturity date the parent contemplates delivering a prepayment notice, it shall be entitled (but not obligated) to request from each lender (by submitting such request in writing to the administrative agent, which will notify the applicable lenders of receipt of such request), and each lender so requested, acting on its own behalf, shall use commercially reasonably efforts to work with the parent in good faith to provide the parent with an indicative estimate of any break costs that would be incurred were the borrower to deliver a prepayment notice. no such request for an estimate shall be deemed to be a break event and no borrower shall be required to deliver a prepayment notice simply as a result of parents request for an estimate. the parties hereto agree and understand that any such estimate provided by any lender shall be a non-binding indicative estimate based on then existing market conditions (which are subject to fluctuation) and actual break costs, if any, shall be calculated by each individual lender in accordance with the terms of this section2.14.  32 for the purposes of this section: break costs means the sum of (without duplication):   (a) the amount, if any (but excluding loss of anticipated applicable margin) by which (x)the interest which a lender would have received under a jpy libor contract for the period from the date of receipt of all or any part of its participation in a loan or any unpaid sum to the last day of the current interest period in respect of that loan or unpaid sum, had such principal amount or unpaid sum been paid on the last day of that interest period, exceeds (y)the amount which that lender would be able to obtain by placing an amount equal to such principal amount or unpaid sum on deposit with a leading bank in the relevant interbank market for a period starting on the business day following receipt or recovery and ending on the last day of the current interest period, plus   (b) any and all related rate fixing breakage costs. mla covered lender means any lender under a particular tranche that is a mandated lead arranger (or one of its affiliates) that has entered into a rate fixing agreement in respect of loans under such tranche. rate fixing agreement means, with respect to any lender, any arrangement entered into by such lender with any counterparty (which may be a third party counterparty or an internal division or entity or an affiliate of such lender) for the purpose of fixing or enabling such lender to fix the rate of interest on any loan (or to otherwise lend such loan on a fixed rate basis). rate fixing breakage amount means, with respect to any lender:   (i) any cost, loss, charge or expense incurred by such lender (all such costs, losses, charges and expenses, rate fixing breakage costs), or   (ii) the net amount received by such lender (net of all losses,

identity of the third party dealer within the specified time period, the non-covered lender shall within the following 3 business days acting in good faith appoint, at the applicable borrowers expense, a third party dealer; the determination of the third party dealer shall be binding and conclusive absent manifest error (in each case, the parent shall provide the third party dealer with the
