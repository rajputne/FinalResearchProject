revolving facility to support a bid in the spectrum auction and purchase, provided that the security will extend to the property of the entity that will own the auctioned spectrum if it is a member of the vl group (subject to the provisions of section9.3) and to its equity interests if held by a member of the vl group (subject to the provisions of section9.3 and if not so held, the provisions of section13.10 shall apply), unless, with respect to such equity interests, such owner is the borrower. letters of credit issued for other purposes hereunder shall not exceed a maximum amount outstanding at any time of $50,000,000. each letter of credit shall be issued in canadian dollars (although letters of credit issued under the swing line may also be in us dollars). concurrently with the delivery of a notice of borrowing requesting a letter of credit, the borrower shall execute and deliver to the issuing lender the documents required by the issuing lender in respect of the requested type of letter of credit, including a letter of credit application and indemnity on the issuing lenders standard forms. in the event of any conflict between the provisions of this agreement and the provisions of any document relating to a letter of credit, the provisions of this agreement shall govern and prevail. the term of each letter of credit shall expire prior to the end of the term and shall not be more than 364 days and shall otherwise be in form and substance satisfactory to the issuing lender. if the borrower wishes to cause the issuance of a letter of credit that has a maturity date expiring after the expiry of the term, the borrower undertakes to provide the agent with lc escrowed funds (as defined in section4.2.5) no later than one (1)business day prior to the

by the borrower, payable quarterly in arrears on the last business day of each calendar quarter, or on such other date as the agent may determine from time to time. 4.2.3 reimbursement obligations. in the event of any drawing under a letter of credit, the issuing lender shall promptly notify the borrower who shall immediately reimburse the amount to the issuing lender in same day funds. in the event that the borrower fails to reimburse the issuing lender immediately upon a drawing and fails to provide a notice of borrowing with a different option, the borrower shall be deemed to have requested from the agent a prime rate advance on the date and in the amount of the drawing, the proceeds of which will be used to satisfy the reimbursement obligations of the borrower to the lenders in respect of the drawing. the reimbursement obligations of the borrower hereunder shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of:   4.2.3.1 any lack of validity or enforceability of any letter of credit or this agreement or any term or provision therein or herein;   4.2.3.2 the existence of any claim, set-off, compensation, defence or other right that the borrower, any member of the vl group or any other person may at any time have against the

transaction;   4.2.3.3 any draft or other document presented under a letter of credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;   4.2.3.4 any dispute between or among the members of the vl group and any beneficiary of any letter of credit or any other party to which such letter of credit may be transferred or any claims whatsoever of the members of the vl group against any beneficiary of such letter of credit or any such transferee; and   4.2.3.5 the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any letter of credit or any of the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.  37. the issuing lender shall not be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any letter of credit, except for errors or omissions that result directly from the intentional or gross fault of the issuing lender, as determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. in furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific provisions of this section4.2, (a)any action taken or omitted by the issuing lender or any of its respective correspondents under or in connection with any of the letters of credit, if taken or omitted in good faith and without gross or intentional fault, as determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, shall be binding upon the borrower and shall not put the issuing lender or its respective correspondents under any resulting liability to the borrower and (b)the issuing lender may, without gross or intentional fault as determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, accept documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a letter of credit, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary (other than an injunction granted by a court of competent jurisdiction during the period for which such injunction is enforced), and may make payment upon presentation of documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such letter of credit, provided that the issuing lender shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to decline to accept such documents and to make such payment if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such letter of credit.   4.2.4 indemnification.   4.2.4.1 the borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the issuing lender and each of its officers, directors, affiliates, employees, advisors and agents (the indemnitees) from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities which the indemnitees may incur (or which may be claimed against any indemnitee) by any person by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of or payment or failure to pay under any letter of credit, provided that the foregoing indemnity will not, as to an indemnitee, apply to losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses to the extent they are found by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court to arise from the gross or intentional fault of such indemnitee.   4.2.4.2 the borrower agrees, as between the borrower and the issuing lender, that the borrower shall assume all risks of the acts, omissions or misuse by the beneficiary of any letter of credit.   4.2.4.3 neither the issuing lender nor the agent or any other lender shall, in any way, be liable for any failure by the issuing lender or anyone else to pay any drawing under any letter of credit as a result of any action by any governmental authority or any other cause beyond the control of the issuing lender.  38.  4.2.4.4 the obligations of the borrower under this section4.2 shall survive the termination of this agreement. no acts or omissions of any current or prior beneficiary of a letter of credit shall in any way affect or impair the rights of the issuing lender to enforce any right, power or benefit under this agreement. 4.2.5 lc escrowed funds. upon the occurrence of an event of default, the borrower will forthwith, upon request from the issuing lender or the agent, pay to the agent for deposit into an escrow account maintained by and in the name of the agent, an amount equal to the issuing lenders maximum potential exposure under the then outstanding letters of credit (the lc escrowed funds). the lc escrowed funds will be held by the agent for compensation or set-off against future indebtedness owing by the borrower to the issuing lender in respect of such letters of credit and pending such application will bear interest at the rate declared by the agent from time to time as that payable by it in respect of deposits for such amount and for the period from the date of deposit to the maturity date of the letters of credit. if such event of default is waived in compliance with the terms of this agreement, then the remaining lc escrowed funds, if any, together with any accrued interest to the date of release, will be released to the borrower. the deposit of the lc escrowed funds by the borrower with the agent as herein provided will not operate as a repayment on account of the loan obligations until such time as the lc escrowed funds are actually paid to the issuing lender as a repayment of principal hereunder. the borrower shall sign and remit as security with regard thereto all appropriate documents that the agent or the issuing lender might judge necessary or desirable. 4.2.6 resignation. the issuing lender may resign as such (a resigning issuing lender) upon 15 days prior written notice to the agent and the borrower, in which event the borrower shall designate another lender as issuing lender. upon acceptance by another lender of the appointment as issuing lender (the successor issuing lender), the successor issuing lender shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the resigning issuing lender and shall have all the rights and obligations of the resigning issuing lender under this agreement and the other loan documents. upon request by any of the resigning issuing lender, the successor issuing lender, the agent or the borrower, each of the resigning issuing lender, the agent, the borrower and the successor issuing lender shall enter into an agreement evidencing the appointment of the successor issuing lender and dealing with such other matters as the parties may agree including any reallocation of fees paid in relation to outstanding letters of credit which may be necessary. following the resignation of the resigning issuing lender, the resigning issuing lender shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an issuing lender under this agreement and the other loan documents with respect to letters of credit issued by it prior to such resignation, but the resigning issuing lender shall not be required to issue additional letters of credit. for avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this agreement relating to the issuing lender shall inure to the benefit of the resigning issuing  39. lender as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it (a)while it was the issuing lender under this agreement or (b)at any time with respect to letters of credit issued by the issuing lender.   4.3 swing line advances 4.3.1 subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement, the swing line lender agrees to make swing line advances to the borrower on any business day from time to time prior to the expiry of the term. swing line advances (other than by letters of credit) may be made or drawn by way of overdrafts on the borrowers account with the swing line lender or by way of irrevocable same business day telephone notice at or before 11:00 a.m. followed by the delivery on the same day of a written notice of confirmation. swing line advances by letter of credit shall be subject to the prior notice as required by the swing line lender in accordance with its normal practices and shall not exceed $1,000,000 in the aggregate outstanding at any time. 4.3.2 the proceeds of swing line advances may be used by the borrower for any purpose for which other advances under the revolving facility may be used. 4.3.3 the swing line loan shall be immediately repaid by the borrower if at any time (and to the extent) it exceeds the maximum of the swing line advances permitted hereunder, either by the borrower submitting a notice of borrowing to request a new advance or by the agent advising the lenders of a deemed notice of borrowing for the same purpose, which notice of borrowing the agent is hereby expressly authorized (but in no way obliged unless requested to do so by the swing line lender) to issue. 4.3.4 if the swing line lender no longer wishes to act as such, it shall notify the borrower, the other lenders and the agent not less than 15 days prior to the date on which it proposes to cease acting as a swing line lender. in such event, the borrower may designate a different swing line lender by sending a notice to (a)the swing line lender who will no longer act as such (the retiring swing line lender), (b)the new swing line lender who has agreed to act as such and (c)the agent, not less than five (5)days prior to the date on which the replacement is to occur. the new swing line lender shall make a prime rate advance or us base rate advance, as applicable, available to the agent for the purpose of repaying the swing line loan owed to the retiring swing line lender on the date such replacement is to occur. 4.3.5 if an event of default shall have occurred, other than an event of default under subsection 14.1.4, or if no lender wishes to act as a replacement for the retiring swing line lender (in such case, the swing line lender is herein referred to as the former swing line lender), the borrower shall be deemed to have made a request for, and each lender shall make, a prime rate advance or us base rate advance, as applicable, available to the agent for the purpose of repaying the principal amount of the swing line loan owed to the former swing line lender, in the amount of such lenders applicable percentage multiplied by the amount of the outstanding swing line loan owing to the former swing line lender (the lender swing line repayments). in such event, the  40. borrowers right to obtain swing line advances will cease and the amounts outstanding thereunder will continue to form part of the loan obligations. however, if an event of default under subsection 14.1.4 shall have occurred, the lenders shall not make such lender swing line repayments and the provisions of subsection 4.3.6 shall apply. 4.3.6 if, before the making of a lender swing line repayment under subsection 4.3.5, a default under subsection 14.1.4 shall have occurred and be continuing or an event of default under subsection 14.1.4 shall have occurred, each lender will, on the date such lender swing line repayment was to have been made, purchase from the former swing line lender an undivided participating interest in the swing line loans to be repaid, in an amount equal to its applicable percentage multiplied by the amount of the outstanding swing line loans, and immediately transfer such amount to the agent for the benefit of the former swing line lender, in immediately available funds. in such event, the borrowers right to obtain swing line advances will cease and the amounts outstanding thereunder will continue to form part of the loan obligations. if at any time after any lender swing line repayment has been made, the former swing line lender receives any payment on account of the swing line loans in respect of which such lender swing line repayment has been made, the former swing line lender will distribute to the agent for the benefit of each lender an amount equal to its applicable percentage multiplied by such amount (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such lenders portion was outstanding and funded) in like funds as received; provided, however, that if such payment received by the former swing line lender is required to be returned, such lender will return to the agent for the benefit of the former swing line lender any portion thereof previously distributed by the former swing line lender to the agent for the benefit of such lender in like funds as such payment is required to be returned by such former swing line lender. 4.3.7 each lenders obligation to make lender swing line repayments or to purchase a participating interest in accordance with subsections 4.3.5 and 4.3.6 shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including, without limitation, (1)any set-off, compensation, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such lender may have against the swing line lender, the borrower or any other person for any reason whatsoever; (2)the occurrence or continuance of any default or event of default; (3)any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the borrower or any other person; (4)any breach of this agreement by the borrower or any other person; (5)any inability of the borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to borrowing set forth in this agreement on the date upon which such prime rate advance is to be made or participating interest is to be purchased or (6)any other circumstances, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing. if any lender does not make available the amount required under subsection 4.3.5 or 4.3.6, as the case may be, the former swing line lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such lender, together with interest thereon at the prime rate basis or the us base rate basis, as the case may be, from the date of non-payment until such amount is paid in full.  41.  4.4 operation of accounts the agent shall maintain in its books at the agency branch a record of the loan obligations, including the bankers acceptances issued by the borrower, attesting as to the total of the borrowers indebtedness to the lenders in accordance with the provisions hereof and with the provisions of the security documents. these accounts or registers shall constitute, in the absence of manifest error, prima facie proof of the total amount of the indebtedness of the borrower to the lenders in accordance with the provisions hereof and of the security documents, of the date of any advance made to the borrower and of the total of all amounts paid by the borrower from time to time with respect to principal and interest owing on the loan obligations and the fees and other sums payable in accordance with the provisions hereof or of the security documents.   4.5 apportionment of advances the amount of each advance will be apportioned among the lenders by the agent by reference to the applicable percentage of each lender, as such applicable percentage shall be immediately prior to the making of any advance, subject to the provisions of subsections 4.3.5 and 4.3.6 hereof with respect to swing line advances, and of section6.8 hereof with respect to ba advances. if any amount is not in fact made available to the agent by a lender, the agent shall be entitled to recover such amount (together with interest thereon at the rate determined by the agent as being its cost of funds in the circumstances) on demand from such lender or, if such lender fails to reimburse the agent for such amount on demand, from the borrower.   4.6 limitations on advances the undrawn credit available under the revolving facility shall cease to be available at the expiry of the disbursement period.   4.7 notices irrevocable any notice given to the agent in accordance with articles 4 or 6 may not be revoked or withdrawn.   4.8 limits on ba advances and letters of credit nothing in this agreement shall be interpreted as authorizing the borrower to issue bankers acceptances for a designated period expiring or, subject to section4.2.1, to cause to be issued letters of credit maturing, on a date which is after the expiry of the term.   4.9 excess resulting from exchange rate change any time that, following one or more fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the canadian dollar, the sum of: 4.9.1 the equivalent amount in canadian dollars of loan obligations under the revolving facility in us dollars; and  42. 4.9.2 the loan obligations under the revolving facility in canadian dollars; exceeds the amount of the credit under the revolving facility then available, the borrower shall promptly either (i)make the necessary payments or repayments to the agent to reduce the loan obligations under the revolving facility to an amount equal to or less than the available amount of the credit under the revolving facility or (ii)maintain or cause to be maintained with the agent, deposits of canadian dollars in an amount equal to or greater than the amount by which the loan obligations under the revolving facility exceed the available amount of the credit under the revolving facility, such deposits to be maintained in such form and upon such terms as are acceptable to the relevant agent. without in any way limiting the foregoing provisions, the agent shall, on the date of each request for an advance or on the date of any interest payment or on each acceptance date or rollover date, make the necessary exchange rate calculations to determine whether any such excess exists on such date and, if there is an excess, it shall so notify the borrower.  5. interest and fees none of the provisions of article 5 shall apply to the finnvera facility lenders or the finnvera term facility, in respect of which the relevant provisions are set out in section4 of schedule p.   5.1 interest on the prime rate basis the principal amount of the loan obligations which at any time and from time to time remains outstanding and in respect of which the borrower has chosen or, in accordance with the provisions hereof, is obliged to pay interest on the prime rate basis or the us base rate basis, shall bear interest, calculated daily, on the daily balance of such loan obligations, from the date of each advance up to and including the day preceding the date of repayment thereof in full at the annual rate (calculated based on a 365 or 366 day year, as the case may be) applicable to each of such days which corresponds to the prime rate or the us base rate, respectively, at the close of business on each of such days, plus the margin.   5.2 payment of interest on the prime rate basis the interest payable in accordance with section5.1 and calculated in the manner described therein shall be payable to the agent monthly, in arrears, on the last day of each month or on such other date (limited to once per month) as the agent may determine and advise the borrower from time to time, the first payment of which shall be payable on the last day of the month in which the first prime rate advance or us base rate advance, respectively, was made.  43.  5.3 derivative obligations the borrower agrees that any amounts due to the agent or the lenders on account of derivative obligations shall be secured by the security.   5.4 interest on the loan obligations where no specific provision with respect to interest on an outstanding portion of the loan obligations is contained in this agreement, the interest on such portion of the loan obligations shall be calculated and payable on the prime rate basis.   5.5 arrears of interest any arrears of interest or principal shall bear interest at a rate that is two percent (2%)per annum higher than the rate of interest payable in respect of the relevant principal amount of the loan obligations and shall be calculated and payable on the same basis.   5.6 maximum interest rate the amount of the interest or fees payable in applying this agreement shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. where the amount of such interest or such fees is greater than the maximum rate, the amount shall be reduced to the highest rate that may be recovered in accordance with the applicable provisions of applicable law. in determining whether the interest contracted for, charged or received by an agent or a lender exceeds the maximum rate, such person may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (a)characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee or premium rather than interest, (b)exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c)amortize, prorate, allocate and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the loan obligations hereunder.   5.7 fees the borrower shall pay the following fees (the revolving facility fees) to the agent and the swing line lender, as applicable:   5.7.1 for the revolving facility lenders, a standby fee (the standby fee) calculated daily by multiplying the amount of the unused credit (calculated based on the maximum amount that could be available under the revolving facility, irrespective of compliance with any conditions precedent or other restrictions) under the revolving facility (including the swing line commitment) each day by the applicable rate set out in the definition of margin, and dividing the result by 365 (or 366 in a leap year), and then multiplying that result by the number of days in the relevant quarter, payable quarterly in arrears two business days following the last day of each calendar quarter, or on such other date as the agent or the swing line lender, as applicable, may determine, acting reasonably; and  44.  5.7.2 for each of the revolving facility lenders, the upfront

per year and expressed as an annual rate is equal to the said rate of interest or fees multiplied by the actual number of days comprised within the calendar year, divided by 360, 365 or 366, as the case may be.   5.8.2 the parties agree that all interest in this agreement will be calculated using the nominal rate method and not the effective rate method, and that the deemed re-investment principle shall not apply to such calculations. in addition, the parties acknowledge that there is a material distinction between the nominal and effective rates of interest and that they are capable of making the calculations necessary to compare such rates.  6. bankers acceptances none of the provisions of article 6 shall apply to the finnvera facility lenders or the finnvera term facility, in

rollover date, in a minimum selected amount, with respect to each designated period, of $5,000,000 or such greater  45.  amount which is an integral multiple of $1,000,000, shall have a designated period of 10 to 180 days (or such other period as may be available and acceptable to the agent), subject to availability, and shall, in no event, mature on a date after the expiry of the applicable term.   6.1.2 prior to making any ba request, the borrower shall deliver:   (a) to the lenders, in the name of each lender which is a bank that accepts bankers acceptances (a ba lender), drafts in form and substance acceptable to the agent and the lenders; and   (b) to the lenders in the name of each lender which is not a bank or does not accept bankers acceptances (a non-ba lender), discount notes; completed and executed by its authorized signatories in sufficient quantity for the advance requested and in appropriate denominations to facilitate the sale of the bankers acceptances in the financial markets. no lender shall be responsible or liable for its failure to accept a bankers acceptance hereunder if such failure is due, in whole or in part, to the failure of the borrower to give appropriate instructions to the agent on a timely basis, nor shall the agent or any lender be liable for any damage, loss or other claim arising by reason of any loss or improper use of any such instrument except a loss or improper use arising by reason of the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the agent, such lender, or their respective employees. in order to facilitate issuances of bankers acceptances pursuant hereto, in accordance with the instructions given from time to time by the borrower, the borrower hereby authorizes each lender, and for this purpose appoints each lender

any debits necessary in its account in order to pay the bankers acceptances which are outstanding and maturing.   6.7 prepayment of bankers acceptances notwithstanding any provision hereof, the borrower may not prepay any bankers acceptance other than on its maturity date; however, this provision shall not prevent the borrower from acquiring, in its discretion but subject to the other provisions of this agreement, any bankers acceptance in circulation from time to time.   6.8 apportionment amongst the lenders the agent is authorized by the borrower and each lender to allocate amongst the lenders the bankers acceptances to be issued and purchased in such manner and amounts as the agent may, in its sole discretion, but acting reasonably, consider necessary, so as to ensure that no lender is required to accept and purchase a bankers acceptance for a fraction of $100,000, and in such event, the lenders respective commitments in any such bankers acceptances and repayments thereof shall be altered accordingly. further, the agent is authorized by the borrower and each lender to cause the proportionate share of one or more lenders advances (calculated based on its commitment) to be exceeded by no more than $100,000 each as a result of such allocations provided that the principal amount of outstanding advances, including bankers acceptances, shall not thereby exceed the maximum amount of the respective commitment of each lender. any resulting amount by which the requested face amount of any such bankers acceptance shall have been so reduced shall be advanced, converted or continued, as the case may be, as a prime rate advance, to be made contemporaneously with the ba advance.  49.  6.9 cash deposits each lender may, in its discretion, at any time, in the absence of any demand by the borrower to such effect, grant an advance to the borrower, the amount of which shall be equivalent to the face value of all bankers acceptances then in circulation which have been accepted, which advance shall not bear interest. the amount of the advance shall not be taken into account in order to calculate the amount of the credit used pursuant hereto. the agent shall retain the amount of the advance in a non-interest bearing cash collateral account as security, for the benefit of the borrower, which amount may be entirely set-off against the amount of the advance and the amount of the bankers acceptances in circulation which such lender has accepted and may be imputed, in the lenders discretion, to the payment of the bankers acceptances at their maturity. the borrower shall sign and remit as security with regard thereto all appropriate documents which the lenders might judge necessary or desirable, specifically including an assignment of the credit balance of the deposit account held as security.   6.10 days of grace the borrower shall not claim from the lenders any days of grace for the payment at maturity of any bankers acceptances presented and accepted by the lenders pursuant to the provisions of this agreement. further, the borrower waives any defence to payment which might otherwise exist if for any reason a bankers acceptance shall be held by any lender in its own right at the maturity thereof.   6.11 obligations absolute the obligations of the borrower with respect to bankers acceptances shall be unconditional and irrevocable and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the provisions of this agreement under all circumstances, including the following circumstances:   6.11.1 any lack of validity or enforceability of any draft accepted by any lender as a bankers acceptance; or   6.11.2 the existence of any claim, set-off, defence or other right which the borrower may have at any time against the holder of a bankers acceptance, the lenders, or any other person or entity, whether in connection with this agreement or otherwise.   6.12 depository bills and notes act bankers acceptances may be issued in the form of a depository bill and deposited with a clearing house, both terms as defined in the depository bills and notes act. the agent and the borrower shall agree on the procedures to be followed, acting reasonably. the lenders are also authorized to issue depository bills as replacements for previously issued bankers acceptances, on the same terms as those replaced, and deposit them with a clearing house against cancellation of the previously issued bankers acceptances.  50. 7. illegality, increased costs, indemnification and market disruptions   7.1 illegality if any lender determines that any law (whether or not as a result of a change in law) has made it unlawful, or that any governmental authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any lender or its applicable lending office to (a)make any advance or maintain any loan obligations (or to maintain its obligation to make any advance, including any ba advance, letter of credit or participation in a letter of credit), or (b)determine or charge interest rates based upon any particular rate, then, on notice thereof by such lender to the borrower through the agent (in the case of a revolving facility lender) or the finnvera facility agent (in the case of a finnvera facility lender), any obligation of such lender with respect to the activity that is unlawful shall be suspended until such lender notifies the agent or the finnvera facility agent, as the case may be, and the borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. upon receipt of such notice, the borrower shall, upon demand from such lender (with a copy to the agent), prepay or, if conversion would avoid the unlawful activity, convert any affected loan obligations, or take any necessary steps with respect to any letter of credit, in order to avoid the activity that is unlawful. upon any such prepayment or conversion, the borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. each lender agrees to designate a different lending office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such lender.   7.2 increased costs   7.2.1 general. if any change in law shall:   (a) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any lender;   (b) subject any lender to any

on any lender or the applicable interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this agreement or advances by or loan obligations owed to such lender or any letter of credit or participation therein;  51. and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such lender of making any advance or maintaining any loan obligations (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such advance), or to increase the cost to such lender or the issuing lender of participating in, issuing or maintaining any letter of credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any letter of credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such lender or the issuing lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount), then upon request of such lender the borrower will pay to such lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.   7.2.2 capital requirements. if any lender determines that any change in law affecting such lender or any lending office of such lender or such lenders holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of increasing the cost to such lender of making or maintaining its commitment or any advance or loan obligation, or reducing any amount otherwise receivable by such lender hereunder with respect thereto, then from time to time the borrower will pay to such lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such lender or its holding company for any such reduction suffered.   7.2.3 certificates for reimbursement. a certificate of a lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsections 7.2.1 or 7.2.2 hereof, including reasonable detail of the basis of calculation thereof, and delivered to the borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. the borrower shall pay such lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 15 business days after receipt thereof.   7.2.4 delay in requests. failure or delay on the part of any lender to demand compensation pursuant to this section shall not constitute a waiver of such lenders right to demand such compensation, except that the borrower shall not be required to compensate a lender pursuant to this section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that such lender notifies the borrower of the change in law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such lenders intention to claim compensation therefor, unless the change in law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, in which case the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.   7.3 taxes   7.3.1 payments free of taxes. any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the borrower hereunder or under any other loan document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any indemnified taxes or

vl group when payable as necessary so that after making or allowing for all required deductions and payments (including deductions and payments applicable to additional sums payable under this section) the agent, the finnvera facility agent or the lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or payments been required, (ii)the member of the vl group shall make any such deductions required to be made by it under applicable law and (iii)the member of the vl group shall timely pay the full amount required to be deducted to the

certain refunds. if the agent, the finnvera facility agent (as applicable) or a lender determines, acting reasonably, that it has received a refund of any taxes or other taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the borrower or with respect to which a member of the vl group has paid additional amounts pursuant to this section or that, because of the payment of such taxes or other taxes, it has benefited from a reduction in excluded taxes otherwise payable by it, it shall pay to the borrower or other member of the vl group, as applicable, an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the borrower or other member of the vl group under this section with respect to the taxes or other taxes giving rise to such refund or reduction), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the agent, the finnvera facility agent or such lender, as the case may be (without duplication of any such expenses if previously reimbursed), and

event of default occurs, and within the limits contemplated by section12.14, the agent may impute to the account of the lenders and pay to other persons reasonable sums for services rendered with respect to the realization, recovery, sale, transfer, delivery and obtaining of payment with respect to the security and may deduct the amount of such costs and payments from the proceeds which it receives therefrom. the balance of such proceeds may be held by the agent in the place of such security and, when the agent decides it is opportune, may be applied to the account of the part of the indebtedness of the borrower to the lenders which the agent deems preferable, without prejudice to the rights of the lenders against the borrower for any loss of profit.   14.6 relations with the borrower the agent may grant delays, take security or renounce thereto, accept compromises, grant acquittances and releases and otherwise negotiate with the borrower as it deems advisable without in

market or the canadian exchange market, as the case may be, the first currency with the second currency on the date on which the judgment is rendered, the sum is payable or advanced or to be advanced, as the case may be. the borrower agrees that its obligations in respect of any first currency due from it to the lenders in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, notwithstanding any judgment rendered or payment made in the second currency, be discharged by a payment made to the agent on account thereof in the second currency only to the extent that, on the business day following receipt of such payment in the second currency, the agent or the finnvera facility agent, as applicable, may, in accordance with normal banking procedures, purchase on the canadian money market or the canadian foreign exchange market, as the case may be, the first currency with the amount of the second currency so paid or which a judgment rendered payable (the rate applicable to such purchase being in this section called the fx rate); and if the amount of the first currency which may be so purchased is less than the amount originally due in the first currency, the borrower agrees as a separate and independent obligation and notwithstanding any such payment or judgment to indemnify the lenders against such deficiency.   15.2 determination of an equivalent currency if, in their discretion, the lenders, the agent or the finnvera facility agent choose or, pursuant to the terms of this agreement, are obliged to choose the equivalent in canadian dollars of any securities or amounts expressed in us dollars or the equivalent in us dollars of any securities or amounts expressed in canadian dollars, the agent or the finnvera facility agent, as the case may be, in accordance with the conversion rules as stipulated in section15.1  85.  15.2.1 on the date indicated in the notice of borrowing as the date of a request for an advance; and   15.2.2 at any other time which in the opinion of the lenders is desirable; may, using the fx rate, at such time on such date, determine the equivalent in canadian dollars or in us dollars, as the case may be (the equivalent amount), of any security or amount expressed in the other currency pursuant to the terms hereof. immediately following such determination, the agent or the finnvera facility agent, as applicable, shall inform the borrower of the conclusion which the lenders have reached.  16. assignment none of the provisions of article 16 shall apply to the finnvera facility lenders or the finnvera term facility, in respect of which the relevant provisions are set out in section10 of schedule p. however, the finnvera facility agent shall advise the agent of any assignments under the finnvera term facility and shall also provide a list of up-to-date commitments of each finnvera facility lender whenever any changes to such commitments occur.   16.1 assignment by the borrower the rights of the borrower under the provisions hereof are purely personal and may not be transferred or assigned, and the borrower may not transfer or assign any of its obligations, such assignment being null and of no effect opposite the lenders and rendering any balance outstanding of the amounts referred to in section14.2 immediately due and payable at the option of the lenders and further releasing the lenders from any obligation to make any further advances under the provisions hereof.   16.2 assignments and transfers by the lenders   16.2.1 no lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i)to an eligible assignee in accordance with the provisions of subsection 16.2.2, or (ii)by way of a sale of a participation in accordance with the provisions of section16.5 (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). nothing in this agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, participants to the extent provided in section16.5 and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the related parties of each of the agent and the lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this agreement.  86.  16.2.2 each lender may assign or transfer to an eligible assignee in accordance with this article 16 up to 100% of its rights, benefits and obligations hereunder; provided that:   (a) except (i)if an event of default has occurred and has not been waived, or (ii)in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning lenders commitment and the loan obligations at the time owing to it, or (iii)in the case of an assignment to a lender or an affiliate of a lender or an approved fund with respect to a lender, the aggregate amount of the commitment being assigned (which for this purpose includes loan obligations outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the loan obligations of the assigning lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the assignment and assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the agent or, if trade date is specified in the assignment and assumption, as of the trade date) shall not be less than $5,000,000, in the case of any assignment in respect of the revolving facility, unless each of the agent and, so long as no event of default has occurred and has not been waived, the borrower, otherwise consent to a lower amount (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);   (b) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning lenders rights and obligations under this agreement with respect to the loan obligations or the commitment assigned, except that this paragraph (b)shall not prohibit any lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations among separate facilities on a non-pro rata basis;   (c) any assignment of a commitment under the revolving facility must be approved by the issuing lender and the swing line lender (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the person that is the proposed assignee is itself already a lender with a commitment under that facility;   (d) any assignment must be approved by the agent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).   (e) any assignment must be approved by the borrower (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed if the eligible assignee is funding its commitment out of the united states of america or canada, but may be withheld in the borrowers discretion if the commitments are being funded from elsewhere)  87.  unless (i)the proposed assignee is itself already a lender with the same type of commitment or (ii)a default has occurred and is continuing or (iii)an event of default has occurred and not been waived; and   (f) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the agent an assignment and assumption agreement, together with a processing and recordation fee in an amount of $3,500, and the eligible assignee, if it is not a lender, shall deliver to the agent an administrative questionnaire. subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the agent pursuant to section16.3, from and after the effective date specified in each assignment and assumption, the eligible assignee thereunder shall be a party to this agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such assignment and assumption, have the rights and obligations of a lender under this agreement, and the assigning lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such assignment and assumption, be released from its obligations under this agreement (and, in the case of an assignment and assumption covering all of the assigning lenders rights and obligations under this agreement, such lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of article 7 and section17.13 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. any assignment or transfer by a lender of rights or obligations under this agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this agreement as a sale by such lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with section16.5. any payment by an assignee to an assigning lender in connection with an assignment shall not be or be deemed to be a repayment by the borrower or a new advance to the borrower.   16.3 register the agent shall maintain at one of its offices in toronto, ontario or montreal, quebec, a copy of each assignment and assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the lenders, and the commitments of, and principal amounts of the loan obligations owing to, each lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the register). the entries in the register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and the borrower, the agent and the lenders may treat each person whose name is recorded in the register pursuant to the terms hereof as a lender hereunder for all purposes of this agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. the register shall be available for inspection by the borrower and any lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.   16.4 electronic execution of assignments the words execution, signed, signature, and words of like import in any assignment and assumption agreement shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or  88. enforceability as

and bank holding companies) regulations under the bank act (canada), parts 2 and 3 of the personal information protection and electronic documents act (canada), an act to establish a legal framework for information technology (quebec), the electronic commerce act, 2000 (ontario) and other similar federal or provincial laws based on the uniform electronic commerce act of the uniform law conference of canada or its uniform electronic evidence act, as the case may be.   16.5 participations any lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the borrower or the agent, sell participations to any person (other than a natural person, a member of the vl group or any affiliate of a member of the vl group) (each, a participant) in all or a portion of such lenders rights and/or obligations under this agreement (including all or a portion of its commitment and/or the loan obligations owing to it); provided that (i)such lenders obligations under this agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii)such lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii)the borrower, the agent and the other lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such lender in connection with such lenders rights and obligations under this agreement. any payment by a participant to a lender in connection with a sale of a participation shall not be or be deemed to be a repayment by the borrower or a new advance to the borrower. subject to section16.6, the borrower agrees that each participant shall be entitled to the benefits of article 7 to the same extent as if it were a lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection 16.2.2. to the extent permitted by applicable law, each participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of section8.11 as though it were a lender, provided such participant agrees to be subject to section18.8 as though it were a lender.   16.6 limitations upon participant rights a participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under sections 7.2 and 7.3 than the applicable lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such participant, unless the sale of the participation to such participant is made with the borrowers prior written consent. a participant that would be a foreign lender if it were a lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of section7.3 unless the borrower is notified of the participation sold to such participant and such participant agrees, for the benefit of the

which the lenders might have, and no omission or delay on the part of the lenders in the exercise of any right shall have the effect of operating as a waiver of such right, and the partial or sole exercise of a right or power will not prevent the lenders from exercising thereafter any other right or power. the provisions of this agreement may only be amended or waived by an instrument in writing (and not orally) in each case signed by the agent with the approval of the requisite majority of lenders.  90.  17.3 determinations final in the absence of any manifest error, any

members of the vl group in accordance with the acts.  93. 18. the agent and the lenders   18.1 authorization of agent   18.1.1 each lender hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the agent to act for all purposes as its agent hereunder and under the security documents with such powers as are expressly delegated to the agent by the terms of this agreement, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto and undertakes not to take any action on its own. notwithstanding the provisions of the civil code of quebec relating to contracts generally and to mandate, the agent shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this agreement. as to any matters not expressly provided for by this agreement, the agent shall act hereunder or in connection herewith in accordance with the instructions of the lenders in accordance with the provisions of this article 18, but, in the absence of any such instructions, the agent may (but shall not be obliged to) act as it shall deem fit in the best interests of the lenders, and any such instructions and any action taken by the agent in accordance herewith shall be binding upon each lender. the agent shall not, by reason of this agreement, be deemed to be a trustee for the benefit of any lender, the borrower or any other person. neither the agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents shall be responsible to the lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties contained in this agreement or in any certificate or other document referred to, or provided for in, or received by any of them under, this agreement, for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this agreement, or any other document referred to or provided for herein or any collateral provided for hereby or for any failure by the borrower to perform its obligations hereunder. the agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care. neither the agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents shall be responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection herewith, except for its or their own gross negligence or wilful misconduct.   18.1.2 for the purposes of creating a solidarit active between each lender, taken individually, and the agent in accordance with article 1541 of the civil code of qubec, the borrower and each lender (on its own behalf) acknowledge and agree with the agent that such lender and the agent are hereby conferred the legal status of solidary creditors of the borrower and the guarantors in respect of all amounts, liabilities and other obligations, present and future, owed by the borrower to the agent and such lender hereunder and under derivative instruments  94.  (collectively, the lender solidary claim). accordingly, but subject (for the avoidance of doubt) to article 1542 of the civil code of qubec, the borrower and each of the guarantors is irrevocably bound towards the agent and each lender in respect of the entire lender solidary claim of the agent and such lender, such that the agent and each lender shall at all times have a valid and effective right of action for the entire lender solidary claim of the agent and such lender and the right to give a full acquittance for it. thus, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the agent, as solidary creditor for itself and each lender, shall at all times have a valid and effective right of action in respect of all amounts, liabilities and other obligations owed by the borrower and the guarantors to the agent and the lenders or any of them hereunder and under derivative instruments and the right to give full acquittance for same. the parties further agree and acknowledge that the security documents described in section9.1 shall be granted to the agent, for its own benefit and for the benefit of the lenders, as solidary creditor as hereinabove set forth.   18.2 agents responsibility   18.2.1 the agent shall be entitled to rely upon any certificate, notice or other document (including any cable, telegram or telecopy) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper person or persons, and upon advice and statements of legal advisers, independent accountants and other experts selected by the agent. the agent may deem and treat each lender as the holder of the commitment in the loan obligations made by such lender for all purposes hereof unless and until an assignment has been completed in accordance with section16.2.   18.2.2 the agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of the occurrence of a default or event of default unless the agent has received notice from a lender or the borrower describing such a default or event of default and stating that such notice is a notice of default. in the event that the agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of a default or event of default or otherwise becomes aware that a default or event of default has occurred, the agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the lenders. the agent shall take such action with respect to such default or event of default as shall be reasonably directed by the lenders in accordance with the provisions of this article 18 provided that, unless and until the agent shall have received such directions, the agent may (but shall not be obliged to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such a default or event of default as it shall deem advisable in the best interest of the lenders.  95.  18.2.3 the agent shall have no responsibility, (a)to the borrower on account of the failure of any lender to perform its obligations hereunder, or (b)to any lender on account of the failure of the borrower to perform its obligations hereunder.   18.2.4 each lender severally represents and warrants to the agent that it has made its own independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of the borrower in connection with the making and continuation of its commitment in the loan obligations hereunder and has not relied on any information provided to such lender by the agent in connection herewith, and each lender represents and warrants to the agent that it shall continue to make its own independent appraisal of the creditworthiness of the borrower while the loan obligations are outstanding or the lenders have any obligations hereunder.   18.3 rights of agent as lender with respect to its commitment in the loan obligations, the agent in its capacity as a lender shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other lender and may exercise the same as though it were not acting as the agent and the term lender shall, unless the context otherwise indicates, include the agent in its capacity as a lender. the agent may (without having to account therefor to any lender) accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of banking or other business with the borrower as if it were not acting as the agent and may accept fees and other consideration from the borrower for customary services in connection with this agreement and the loan obligations and otherwise without having to account for the same to the lenders.   18.4 indemnity each lender agrees to indemnify the agent, to the extent not otherwise reimbursed by the borrower, rateably in accordance with its respective commitments, for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgements, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against, the agent in any way relating to or arising out of this agreement, the security documents or any other documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (excluding, unless a default or event of default is apprehended or has occurred and is continuing, normal administrative costs and expenses incidental to the performance of its agency duties hereunder) or the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or of any such other documents, provided that no lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the agents gross negligence or wilful misconduct.  96.  18.5 notice by agent to lenders as soon as practicable after its receipt thereof, the agent will forward to each lender a copy of each report, notice or other document required by this agreement to be delivered to the agent for such lender.   18.6 protection of agent   18.6.1 the agent shall not be required to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by the borrower of this agreement or any other document referred to or provided for herein or therein or to inspect the properties or books of the borrower. except (in the case of the agent) for notices, reports and other documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the lenders by the agent hereunder, the agent shall have no duty or responsibility to provide any lender with any credit or other information concerning the affairs or financial condition of the borrower which may come to the attention of the agent, except where provided to the agent for the lenders, provided that such information does not confer any advantage to the agent as a lender over the other lenders. nothing in this agreement shall oblige the agent to disclose any information relating to the borrower if such disclosure would or might, in the opinion of the agent, constitute a breach of any applicable laws or duty of secrecy or confidence.   18.6.2 unless the agent shall have been notified in writing or by telegraph or telecopier by any lender prior to the date of an advance requested hereunder that such lender does not intend to make available to the agent such lenders proportionate share of such advance, based on its commitment, the agent may assume that such lender has made such lenders commitment in such advance available to the agent on the date of such advance and the agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the borrower a corresponding amount. if such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the agent by such lender, the agent shall be entitled to recover such amount (together with interest thereon at the rate determined by the agent as being its cost of funds in the circumstances) on demand from such lender or, if such lender fails to reimburse the agent for such amount on demand, from the borrower.   18.6.3 unless the agent shall have been notified in writing or by telegraph or telecopier by the borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due hereunder that the borrower does not intend to make such payment, the agent may assume that the borrower has made such payment when due and the agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to each lender on such payment date an amount equal to such lenders pro rata share of such assumed payment. if it is established  97.  that the borrower has not in fact made such payment to the agent, each lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the agent the amount made available to such lender (together with interest at the rate determined by the agent as being its cost of funds in the circumstances).   18.7 notice by lenders to agent each lender shall endeavour to use its best efforts to notify the agent of the occurrence of any default or event of default forthwith upon becoming aware of such event, but no lender shall be liable if it fails to give such notice to the agent.   18.8 sharing among the lenders each lender agrees as amongst themselves that except as otherwise provided for by the provisions of this agreement, all amounts received by the agents, in their capacity as agents of the lenders pursuant to this agreement or any other document contemplated hereby (whether received by voluntary payment, by the exercise of the right of set-off or compensation or by counterclaim, cross-claim, separate action or as proceeds of realization of any security, other than agency fees), and all amounts received by any lender in relation to this agreement, in each case following a default (which is not remedied subsequent to such receipt) or an event of default (which is not waived subsequent to such receipt), shall be shared by each lender pro rata, in accordance with its respective applicable percentage, and each lender undertakes to do all such things as may be reasonably required to give full effect to this section18.8. if any amount which is so shared is later recovered from the lender who originally received it, each other lender shall restore its proportionate share of such amount to such lender, without interest. as a necessary consequence of the foregoing, each lender shall share, in a percentage equal to its applicable percentage, any losses incurred as a result of any default or event of default by the borrower, and shall pay to the agent, within two (2)business days following a request by the agent, any amount required to ensure that such lender bears its pro rata share of such losses, if any, including any amounts required to be paid to any lender in respect of any bankers acceptances and, for greater certainty, amounts forming part of the swing line loan (which form part of the revolving facility). such obligation to share losses shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including, without limitation, (1)any set-off, compensation, counterclaim, recoupment, defence or other right which such lender may have against the agent, the borrower or any other person for any reason whatsoever; (2)the occurrence or continuance of any default or event of default; (3)any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the borrower or any other person; (4)any breach of this agreement by the borrower or any other person; or (5)any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing. if any lender does not make available the amount required hereunder, the agent shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such lender, together with interest thereon at the prime rate from the date of non-payment until such amount is paid in full.  98.  18.9 derivative obligations   18.9.1 the derivative obligations shall be secured by the security provided that the related derivative instruments: (a) are governed by an isda master agreement or other form of agreement generally accepted in the relevant market; (b) provide that bankruptcy or insolvency constitutes an event of default thereunder; and (c) provide that for the purposes of section6(e) of the 1992 isda master agreement or the 2002 isda master agreement, the methods of calculation set out in the definition of hedging exposure shall apply.   18.9.2 notwithstanding the rights of the revolving facility lenders to benefit from the security in respect of derivative obligations, all decisions concerning the security and the enforcement thereof shall be made by the lenders, the majority lenders or the required lenders-acceleration, as the case may be, in accordance with the provisions of this agreement, excluding the amount owed to any lender in respect of derivative obligations. no lender holding derivative obligations from time to time shall have any additional right to influence the security or the enforcement thereof as a result of holding derivative obligations as long as this agreement remains in force. no such lender shall be able to enforce the security unless the lenders are at the same time enforcing the security for the loan obligations. however, the derivative obligations shall continue to be supported by the security notwithstanding the termination of this agreement by reason of payment in full and termination of the credit, or for any other reason, and all derivative obligations owed to any lender shall continue to be supported by the security after such lender ceases to be an agent or a lender or to have an affiliate which is an agent or a lender. after the termination of this agreement, each holder of derivative obligations shall be entitled, in its sole discretion, to make decisions concerning the security.   18.9.3 each lender shall confirm to the agent the details of each derivative instrument executed by it by or for the benefit of the borrower, including the hedging exposure thereunder, within a reasonable period following request by the agent, if any such request is made.   18.9.4 each lender shall confirm to the agent and to the borrower, upon request, quarterly on or about the last day of each financial quarter of each financial year of the borrower, the hedging exposure under derivative instruments to which it is a party, calculated on a net as well as on a gross basis where several derivative instruments are governed  99.  by the same master agreement. the agent shall then confirm to each lender the total amount of the hedging exposure under derivative obligations with each lender.   18.10 procedure with respect to advances subject to the provisions of this agreement, upon receipt of a notice of borrowing from the borrower, the agent shall, without delay, advise each lender of the receipt of such notice, of the date of such advance, of its proportionate share of the amount of each advance and of the relevant details of the agents account(s). each lender shall disburse its proportionate share of each advance, taking into account its commitment, and shall make it available to the agent (no later than 10:00 a.m.) on the date of the advance fixed by the borrower, by depositing its proportionate share of the advance in the agents account in canadian dollars or us dollars, as the case may be. once the borrower has fulfilled the conditions stipulated in this agreement, the agent will make such amounts available to the borrower on the date of the advance, at the branch, and, in the absence of other arrangements made in writing between the agent and the borrower, by transferring or causing to be transferred an equivalent amount in the case of a direct advance, and the available proceeds (as defined in subsection 6.2.4 (d)) in the case of bankers acceptances, in accordance with the instructions of the borrower which appear in the notice of borrowing with respect to each advance; however, the obligation of the agent with respect hereto is limited to taking the steps judged commercially reasonable in order to follow such instructions, and once undertaken, such steps shall constitute conclusive evidence that the amounts have been disbursed in accordance with the applicable provisions. the agent shall not be liable for damages, claims or costs imputed to the borrower and resulting from the fact that the amount of an advance did not arrive at its agreed-upon destination.   18.11 accounts kept by each lender each lender shall keep in its books, in respect of its commitment, accounts for the prime rate advances, us base rate advances, bankers acceptances and other amounts payable by the borrower under this agreement. each lender shall make appropriate entries showing, as debits, the amount of the debt of the borrower to it in respect of the prime rate advances, us base rate advances and ba advances, as the case may be, the amount of all accrued interest and any other amount due to such lender pursuant hereto and, as credits, each payment or repayment of principal and interest made in respect of such indebtedness as well as any other amount paid to such lender pursuant hereto. these accounts shall constitute (in the absence of manifest error or of contradictory entries in the accounts of the agent referred to in section4.4) prima facie evidence of their content against the borrower. the accounts which are maintained by the agent shall constitute, except in the case of manifest error, prima facie proof of the amounts advanced and the bankers acceptances accepted by each lender, the interest and other amounts due to them and the payments of principal, interest or others made to the lenders.  100.  18.12 binding determinations the agent shall proceed in good faith to make any determination which is required in order to apply this agreement and, once made, such determination shall be final and binding upon all parties, except in the case of manifest error.   18.13 amendment of article 18 the provisions of this article 18 relating to the rights and obligations of the lenders and the agent inter se may be amended or added to, from time to time, by the execution by the agent and the lenders of an instrument in writing and such instrument in writing shall validly and effectively amend or add to any or all of the provisions of this article affecting the lenders without requiring the execution of such instrument in writing by the borrower.   18.14 decisions, amendments and waivers of the lenders when the lenders may or must consent to an action or to anything or to accomplish another act in applying this agreement, the agent shall request that each lender give its consent in this regard. subject to the provisions of sections 18.15 and 14.2, all decisions taken by the lenders shall be taken as follows: a) if there are two lenders, by unanimous consent; b) if there are three or more lenders, by the majority lenders. the agent shall confirm such consent to each lender and to the borrower.   18.15 authorized waivers, variations and omissions if so authorized in writing by the lenders in accordance with the provisions of section18.14, the agent, on behalf of the lenders, may grant waivers, consents, vary the terms of this agreement and the security documents and do or omit to do all acts and things in connection herewith or therewith. notwithstanding the foregoing, except with the prior written agreement of (a)each of the lenders with commitments in the facility being amended (or in respect of which a waiver is requested, each such lender an affected lender), nothing in section18.14 or this section18.15 shall authorize (i)any extension of the date for, or decrease in the amount of, any payment of principal, interest or other amounts or (ii)any extension of any maturity date not applicable to both facilities, and (b)each of the lenders, nothing in section18.14 or this section18.15 shall authorize (i)any change (other than an extension) of the date for, increase in the amount of, or change in the currency or mode of calculation or computation of any payment of principal, interest or other amount (including the amount of the revolving facility or the finnvera term facility, except as provided in section2.3), (ii)any extension of any maturity date applicable to both facilities, (iv)any change in the terms of article 18, (v)any change in the manner of making decisions among the lenders including the definition of majority lenders and required lenders-acceleration, (vi)the release of the borrower or any guarantor, except as provided herein with respect to permitted asset dispositions or as contemplated in section13.1, (vii)the release, in whole or in part, of any of the security documents or the security constituted thereby, except as provided herein with respect to permitted asset dispositions (in section13.3) or as contemplated in section13.1, (viii)any change in or any waiver of the conditions precedent provided for in article 10 or (ix)any  101. amendment to this section18.15. waivers of events of default not requiring the unanimous consent of the lenders may be granted by the majority lenders or, for events of default requiring a waiver in the circumstances described in (a)above, the affected lenders (and not by the required lenders-acceleration). in addition, no amendment to or waiver of (a)section4.2 shall be made without the consent of the issuing lenders, (b)section4.3 shall be made without the consent of the swing line lender, and (c)the definition of defaulting lender without the consent of the agent, the finnvera agent, the issuing lender and the swing line lender.   18.16 provisions for the benefit of lenders only  power of attorney for quebec purposes without limiting the powers of the agent hereunder or under the security documents and to the extent applicable, each of the lenders hereby acknowledges that the agent (or a collateral agent designated by the agent) shall, for the purposes of holding any security granted under the hypothecs described in section9.1.3 hereof to secure payment of the debentures, be the holder of an irrevocable power of attorney (fond de pouvoir) (within the meaning of article 2692 of the civil code of quebec) for all present and future lenders and in particular for all present and future holders of the debentures. each of the lenders hereby constitutes, to the extent necessary, the agent (or such designated collateral agent) as the holder of such irrevocable power of attorney in order to hold security granted under such hypothecs to secure the debentures. each assignee shall be deemed to have confirmed and ratified the constitution of the agent as the holder of such irrevocable power of attorney by execution of the relevant transfer agreement. notwithstanding the provisions of section32 of the an act respecting the special powers of legal persons (quebec), the borrower, the guarantors and the lenders irrevocably agree that the agent may acquire and be the holder of a debenture. by executing a debenture, the issuer of the debenture shall be deemed to have acknowledged that the debenture constitutes a title of indebtedness, as such term is used in article 2692 of the civil code of quebec.   18.17 defaulting lenders   18.17.1 notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, if any lender becomes a defaulting lender, then the provisions of this section18.17 shall apply until the agent (or in the case of a defaulting lender under the finnvera term facility, the finnvera facility agent), the borrower, the issuing lender and the swing line lender all agree that the defaulting lender has remedied all matters that caused it to be a defaulting lender.   18.17.2 any standby fee shall cease to accrue on the defaulting lenders unadvanced portion of any advance.   18.17.3 the defaulting lender shall not be entitled to exercise any right of consent under sections 18.14 or 18.15 and its commitment shall not be included in determining whether the lenders or the majority lenders  102.  have provided any consent under those sections. however, the defaulting lender shall be entitled to exercise its right of consent in respect of (a)any matter that requires its consent hereunder including, for the avoidance of doubt, any increase in the amount of the revolving facility or the finnvera term facility except as provided in section2.3 or the extension of the commitment of such defaulting lender, and (b)any matter that requires the consent of all lenders, but only if it would be affected differently than the other lenders.   18.17.4 the borrowers right to receive advances of the defaulting lenders unadvanced commitment under the facilities shall be suspended and the participation of the other lenders in the facilities including the swing line shall be re-adjusted on a pro rata basis without regard to the unadvanced commitment of the defaulting lender but without increasing the overall commitments of the other lenders. if (a)the unadvanced commitments of the other lenders would not be sufficient to cover their obligations together with the obligations of the defaulting lender under section4.2 or 4.3, or (b)an event of default has occurred and not been waived, then the borrower shall repay the swing line loan and shall provide lc escrowed funds to the issuing lender to secure letters of credit to the extent necessary to cover the deficiency.   18.17.5 if the borrower provides lc escrowed funds to the issuing lenders to secure letters of credit, the borrower shall not be required to pay lc fees for the account of the defaulting lender in respect of the amount for which it has provided lc escrowed funds. if the obligation of the defaulting lender regarding letters of credit under section4.2 is borne by the other lenders as a result of subsection18.17.4, then the other lenders shall be entitled to receive any lc fee that would otherwise have
