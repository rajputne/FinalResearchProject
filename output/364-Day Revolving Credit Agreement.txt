dismiss the complaint in its entirety for failure to state a claim. in lieu of filing its opposition papers to this motion, discover filed an amended complaint on january7, 2005. in the amended complaint, discover dropped some of its claims, including its challenge against the no surcharge rule and its claims under californias unfair competition law, but continued to allege that the implementation and enforcement of visa u.s.a.s bylaw 2.10(e), mastercards cpp, and the honor all cards rule violated sections 1 and 2 of the sherman act. on june7, 2007, discover filed a second amended complaint, which eliminated allegations related to the honor all cards rule, dropped attempted monopolization and monopolization claims against mastercard and visa international to conform to the courts rulings on motions to dismiss, and made technical changes to the names of the plaintiffs. specifically, discover claims that visa u.s.a.s bylaw 2.10(e) unreasonably restrained trade by prohibiting financial institutions that were members of visa u.s.a. from issuing payment cards on the discover network in the united states. discover requests that the district court apply collateral estoppel with respect to the courts final judgment in the doj litigation and enter an order that bylaw 2.10(e) and the cpp have injured competition and caused injury to discover. discover seeks treble damages in an amount to be proved at trial, along with attorneys fees and costs. on february7, 2005, visa u.s.a. and visa international moved to dismiss discovers amended complaint in its entirety for failure to state a claim. on april14, 2005, the district court denied, at this stage in the litigation, discovers request to give collateral estoppel effect to the findings in the doj litigation. however, the district court indicated that discover may refile a motion for collateral estoppel after discovery. under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, a court has the discretion to preclude one or more issues from being relitigated in a subsequent action if: (1)the same issues were actually litigated and determined in the prior action; (2)proof of those issues was necessary to reach the prior judgment; and (3)the party to be estopped had a full and fair opportunity to litigate those issues in the prior action. accordingly, if the district court were to give effect to collateral estoppel on one or more issues in the future, then significant elements of plaintiffs claims would be established, thereby making it more likely that visa u.s.a. and visa international would be found liable and making the possibility of an award of damages more likely. in the event all issues are subsequently decided against visa u.s.a. and visa international in dispositive motions during the course of the litigation, then there is the possibility that the sole issue remaining will be whether a damage award is appropriate and, if so, what the amount of damages should be. also on april14, 2005, and in subsequent rulings, with respect to the alleged market for general purpose card network services, the district court denied visa u.s.a.s motion to dismiss discovers section1 conspiracy to restrain trade claims and section2 monopolization, attempted monopolization and conspiracy to monopolize claims that were based upon the conduct described above. on october24, 2005, the court granted visa internationals motion to dismiss discovers attempted monopolization and monopolization claims against it, because plaintiffs did not allege that visa international individually had sufficient market share to maintain these claims. on november9,   1  schedule 5.7 2005, the court denied visa u.s.a. and visa internationals motion to dismiss discovers claims based upon effects in an alleged debit market. visa u.s.a. and visa international answered the amended complaint on november30, 2005. fact discovery is complete. at a hearing on april25, 2007, the district court set a trial date of september9, 2008. the court also established deadlines and procedures for motions practice and expert discovery. on july24, 2007, discover served its experts report purporting to demonstrate that it had incurred substantial damages. expert reports were served jointly by visa u.s.a. and visa international on october9, 2007. the american express litigation on november15, 2004, american express filed a complaint against visa u.s.a., visa international, mastercard and eight visa u.s.a. and visa international member financial institutions (jpmorgan chase& co., bank of america corporation, capital one financial corp., u.s. bancorp, household international inc., wells fargo& company, providian financial corp., and u.s.a.a. federal savings bank). subsequently, u.s.a.a. federal savings bank, bank of america corp. and household international inc. announced settlements with american express and were dismissed from the case. the complaint, which was filed in the u.s. district court for the southern district of newyork, was designated as a related case to the doj litigation and was assigned to the same judge. see department of justice antitrust case and related litigation. the complaint alleged that the implementation and enforcement of visa u.s.a.s bylaw 2.10(e) and mastercards cpp violated sections 1 and 2 of the sherman act in an alleged market for general purpose card network services and an alleged market for debit card network services. we, visa u.s.a. and visa international entered into a settlement agreement with american express that became effective on november9, 2007. under the settlement agreement, american express will receive maximum payments of $2.25 billion, including up to $2.07 billion from us and $185 million from five co-defendant banks. an initial payment of $1.13 billion will be made on or before march31, 2008, including $945 million from us and $185 million from the five co-defendant banks. beginning march31, 2008, we will pay american express an additional amount of up to $70 million each quarter for 16 quarters, for a maximum total of $1.12 billion. the quarterly payments are contingent upon the performance of american expresss united states global network services (gns) business and will be in an amount equal to 5% of american expresss united states gns billings during the quarter up to a maximum of $70 million per quarter; provided, however, that if the payment for any quarter is less than $70 million, the maximum payment for a future quarter or quarters shall be increased by the difference between $70 million and such lesser amount as was actually paid. the settlement will be covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. the attridge litigation on december8, 2004, a complaint was filed in california state court on behalf of a putative class of consumers asserting claims against visa u.s.a., visa international and mastercard under californias cartwright act and unfair competition law. the claims in this action, attridge v. visa u.s.a. inc., et al., seek to piggyback on the portion of the doj antitrust litigation in which the u.s. district court for the southern district of new york found that visas bylaw 2.10(e) and mastercards competitive programs policy constitute unlawful restraints of trade under the federal antitrust laws. see department of justice antitrust case and related litigation. after the plaintiff twice amended his complaint, visa u.s.a., visa international and mastercard demurred to (moved to dismiss) the complaint and, at a hearing on november2, 2005, the court dismissed plaintiffs claims with leave to amend. on december2, 2005, the plaintiff filed a third amended complaint. the defendants again demurred to (moved to dismiss) that complaint. on may19, 2006, the court entered an order dismissing plaintiffs cartwright act claims with prejudice but allowing the plaintiff to proceed with his unfair competition law claims. on june19, 2006, visa u.s.a. and visa international answered the third amended complaint. the parties are now moving forward with discovery. the interchange litigation on october8, 2004, a purported class action lawsuit was filed by a group of merchants in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california against visa u.s.a. inc., mastercard and several visa u.s.a. member financial institutions alleging, among other things, that visa u.s.a.s and mastercards interchange fees contravene the sherman act and the clayton act, kendall v. visa u.s.a. inc., et al. the plaintiffs seek treble damages in an   2  schedule 5.7 unspecified amount, attorneys fees and an injunction against visa u.s.a. and mastercard from setting interchange and engaging in joint marketing activities, which plaintiffs allege include the purported negotiation of merchant discount rates with certain merchants. on november19, 2004, visa u.s.a. filed an answer to the complaint. the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on april25, 2005. visa u.s.a. moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim and, in the alternative, also moved for summary judgment with respect to certain of the claims. on july25, 2005, the court issued an order granting visa u.s.a.s motion to dismiss and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. on august10, 2005, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. plaintiffs opening appeal brief was filed on november28, 2005. visa filed its opposition brief to plaintiffs appeal on january26, 2006 and plaintiffs filed their reply on february23, 2006. the ninth circuit heard oral argument on the plaintiffs appeal on june11, 2007. no ruling has been issued. on may6, 2005, a purported class action lawsuit was filed by a merchant, animal land, inc., against visa u.s.a. in the u.s. district court for the northern district of georgia, alleging that visa u.s.a.s no-surcharge rule violates sections 1 and 2 of the sherman act. plaintiff alleges that under the no-surcharge rule, merchants are not permitted to pass along to cardholders a discrete surcharge to account for the fees that the merchant pays in connection with visa-branded payment card transactions. plaintiff alleges that this rule causes the fees paid by merchants to be supracompetitive. the suit seeks treble damages in an unspecified amount, attorneys fees and injunctive relief. the animal land case has been transferred to the multidistrict litigation proceedings and is included in the first amended class action complaint discussed below. on june22, 2005, a purported class action lawsuit was filed by a group of merchants in the u.s. district court of connecticut against mastercard, visa u.s.a., visa international and a number of visa u.s.a. and visa international member financial institutions alleging, among other things, that visas and mastercards purported setting of interchange fees violates section1 of the sherman act. in addition, the complaint alleges visas and mastercards purported tying and bundling of transaction fees also constitutes a violation of section1 of the sherman act. since the filing of this complaint, there have been approximately 48 similar complaints, the majority styled as class actions, although 10 complaints are on behalf of individual plaintiffs, filed on behalf of merchants against visa u.s.a. and mastercard, and in some cases, certain visa u.s.a. and visa international member financial institutions, in federal courts in california, connecticut, kentucky, new jersey, new york, ohio, pennsylvania, south carolina and wisconsin. visa international was named as a defendant in more than 30 of these complaints. on october19, 2005, the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation issued an order transferring these cases to the u.s. district court for the eastern district of new york for coordination of pre-trial proceedings. on april24, 2006, the group of purported class plaintiffs filed a first amended class action complaint. taken together, the claims in the first amended class action complaint and in the 10 complaints brought on behalf of individual merchants are generally brought under sections 1 and 2 of the sherman act. specifically, the complaints contain some or all of the following claims: (i)that visas and mastercards setting of interchange fees (for both credit and offline debit transactions) violates section1 of the sherman act; (ii)that visa and mastercard have enacted and enforced various rules, including the no surcharge rule and purported anti-steering rules, in violation of section1 or 2 of the sherman act; (iii)that visas and mastercards purported bundling of the acceptance of premium credit cards to standard credit cards constitutes an unlawful tying arrangement; and (iv)that visa and mastercard have unlawfully tied and bundled transaction fees. in addition to the claims brought under federal antitrust law, some of these complaints contain certain state unfair competition law claims based upon the same conduct described above. these interchange-related litigations also seek treble damages in an unspecified amount (although several of the complaints allege that the plaintiffs expect that damages will range in the tens of billions of dollars), as well as attorneys fees and injunctive relief. visa u.s.a. and visa international answered the first consolidated amended class action complaint and the individual merchant complaints on june9, 2006. the court has ordered that new fact discovery may proceed and such fact discovery is scheduled to be completed by november30, 2007. expert discovery is scheduled to be completed by july18, 2008. summary judgment and other pretrial motions are scheduled to be completed by november24, 2008. on july10, 2007, pursuant to a joint request by the parties, the court entered an amended scheduling order extending the deadline for fact discovery to june30, 2008, expert discovery to february20, 2009, and the deadline for completion of all summary judgment and other pretrial motions to march27, 2009. on september7, 2007, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation to the district court recommending that the district court grant the defendants motion to dismiss the class plaintiffs claims for damages incurred prior to january1, 2004. on october12, 2007, the magistrate judge granted putative class   3  schedule 5.7 plaintiffs request to brief the issue of whether the report and recommendation would affect the claims of non-party members of the putative class that opted out of the in re visa check/ mastermoney antitrust litigation class action. following the submissions, the magistrate judge declined plaintiffs request to advise on that issue and set a november14, 2007 deadline for filing objections to the report and recommendation. retailers litigation commencing in october 1996, several class action suits were brought by a number of u.s. merchants against visa u.s.a. and mastercard challenging certain aspects of the payment card industry under u.s. federal antitrust laws. those suits were later consolidated in the u.s. district court for the eastern district of new york, in re visa check/mastermoney antitrust litigation. the plaintiffs claimed that visa u.s.a.s honor all cards rule, which required merchants that accepted visa cards to accept for payment every validly presented visa card, and a similar mastercard rule, constituted an illegal tying arrangement in violation of section1 of the sherman act. the plaintiffs claimed that visa u.s.a. and mastercard unlawfully tied acceptance of debit cards to acceptance of credit cards. the plaintiffs also claimed that visa u.s.a. and mastercard conspired to monopolize what the plaintiffs characterized as the alleged point-of-sale debit card market, thereby suppressing the growth of regional networks such as atm payments systems. on june4, 2003, visa u.s.a. signed a settlement agreement to settle the claims brought by the plaintiffs in this matter, which the court approved on december19, 2003. pursuant to the settlement agreement, visa agreed to modify its honor all cards rule such that, effective january1, 2004, a merchant may accept only visa check cards, only visa credit cards, or both. visa also agreed to pay approximately $2.0 billion to the merchant class over 10 years, among other things. a number of class members appealed the district courts approval of the settlement. these appeals largely focused on the courts attorneys fees award as well on the courts ruling on the scope of the release set forth in the settlement agreement. on january4, 2005, the second circuit court of appeals issued an order affirming the district courts approval of the settlement agreement. a petition for certiorari by two objectors was denied by the united states supreme court on may16, 2005. accordingly, the settlement is now final. several lawsuits were commenced by merchants that opted not to participate in the plaintiff class in in re visa check/mastermoney antitrust litigation, including best buy stores, cvs, giant eagle, inc., the home depot u.s.a. inc., toys r us and gmri, inc. the majority of these cases were filed in the u.s. district court for the eastern district of new york. visa u.s.a. has entered into separate settlement agreements with all but one of these plaintiffs resolving their claims, and the district court has entered orders dismissing with prejudice each of those plaintiffs complaints against visa u.s.a. only the action brought by gmri, inc. against visa u.s.a. remains pending. on may14, 2007, the plaintiff in the gmri, inc. case sought to amend its complaint and consolidate the case with multidistrict litigation 1720. see retrospective responsibility plancovered litigationinterchange litigation. visa u.s.a., visa international and several of their member financial institutions named as defendants in multidistrict litigation 1720 opposed the plaintiffs motion. on june1, 2007, the plaintiff withdrew its request. on june22, 2007, gmri, inc. filed suit against visa international and various member financial institutions of visa u.s.a. and/or visa international, alleging both the merchant opt-out claims at issue in gmris suit against visa u.s.a. and a number of the claims set forth in the class complaint filed in multidistrict litigation 1720 relating to interchange and visa rules. in addition, complaints have been filed in 19 different states and the district of columbia alleging state antitrust, consumer protection and common law claims against visa u.s.a. and mastercard (and, in one state, against visa international) on behalf of putative classes of consumers. the claims in these actions largely mirror the allegations made in the u.s. merchant lawsuit and assert that merchants, faced with excessive merchant discount fees, have passed on some portion those fees to consumers in the form of higher prices on goods and services sold. visa u.s.a. has been successful in the majority of these cases, as courts have granted visa u.s.a.s motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim or plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed their complaints. specifically, courts in arizona, the district of columbia, florida, iowa, kansas, maine, michigan, minnesota, nebraska, nevada, new york, north carolina, north dakota, south dakota, tennessee, vermont and wisconsin have granted visa u.s.a.s motions and dismissed the complaints. the parties are awaiting a decision on visa u.s.a.s motion to dismiss in new mexico. in california, the court granted visa u.s.a. and visa internationals demurrer, or motion to dismiss, with respect to claims brought under the cartwright act, but denied a similar motion with respect to unfair competition law claims for unlawful, unfair, and/or fraudulent business practices. visa u.s.a. and visa international subsequently filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings seeking dismissal of those latter claims in light of the proposition 64 amendments to the unfair competition law. after oral argument, the court denied this   4  schedule 5.7 motion on march6, 2007. the california court of appeal rejected a petition seeking immediate review of that decision on june7, 2007. on july24, 2007, a case management conference was held at which the court permitted certain further discovery and agreed to address plaintiffs proposed motion for collateral estoppel with respect to certain elements of a tying claim based on statements in the decision on cross-motions for summary judgment in in re visa check/mastermoney antitrust litigation, no.96-5238 (e.d.n.y.). at a case management conference on october31, 2007, the court denied the plaintiffs collateral estoppel motion and set a new case management conference for january18, 2008. in west virginia, the action was brought against visa u.s.a. by west virginias attorney general as parens patriae for west virginia consumers. the court denied visa u.s.a.s motion for summary judgment on october14, 2005. on february14, 2006, visa u.s.a. answered the west virginia complaint and the parties began discovery. on april10, 2007, the court issued a stay of discovery pending its ruling on an antitrust standing issue. on april27, 2007, visa u.s.a. and the state of west virginia reached an agreement in principle to settle all claims against visa u.s.a. a provision was recorded in visa u.s.a.s consolidated statements of operations in connection with this settlement. on february17, 2005, plaintiffs filed a complaint in ohio state court on behalf of a putative class of consumers asserting claims under ohio state antitrust and common laws. the claims in that action mirror those in the consumer actions described above but also name as co-defendants a purported class of merchants that were class members in in re visa check/mastermoney antitrust litigation. plaintiffs allege that visa u.s.a., mastercard and the class members in the u.s. merchant lawsuit conspired to attempt to monopolize an alleged debit card market by tying debit card acceptance to credit card acceptance. on october7, 2005, plaintiffs filed a voluntary notice of dismissal of the ohio complaint. two similar actions also were filed in tennessee state and federal court on february17, 2005, but visa u.s.a. and mastercard were not named as defendants in those actions. the tennessee state court action was refiled in federal court and both actions were transferred to the federal court for the eastern district of new york on september29, 2006. on september25, 2007, the court granted the defendants motion to dismiss the claims in those actions except for those asserted under tennessee state law, and asked the parties to show cause why the cases should not be transferred back to the tennessee federal court. both plaintiffs and defendants oppose the transfer. department of justice antitrust case and related litigation in october 1998, the u.s. department of justice, or doj, filed suit against visa u.s.a., visa international and mastercard in the u.s. district court for the southern district of new york alleging that both visa u.s.a.s and mastercards governance structures and policies violated u.s. federal antitrust laws. first, the doj claimed that dual governancethe situation where an employee of a member financial institution also serves on the board of directors of visa u.s.a. or mastercard while a portion of its card portfolio is issued under the brand of the other associationwas anti-competitive and acted to limit innovation within the payment card industry. second, the doj challenged visa u.s.a.s bylaw 2.10(e), which prohibited visa members from issuing american express or discover cards, and challenged a similar mastercard rule known as the competitive programs policy, or cpp. the doj alleged that visa u.s.a.s bylaw 2.10(e) and mastercards cpp acted to restrain competition. on october9, 2001, the district court issued an opinion upholding the legality and pro-competitive nature of dual governance. however, the court also held that visa u.s.a.s bylaw 2.10(e) and mastercards cpp constituted unlawful restraints of trade under the federal antitrust laws. on november26, 2001, the court issued a final judgment that ordered visa u.s.a. to repeal bylaw 2.10(e) and enjoined visa u.s.a. and visa international from enacting or enforcing any bylaw, rule, policy or practice that prohibits its issuers from issuing general purpose credit or debit cards in the united states on any other general purpose card network. the final judgment also provided that from the effective date of the final judgment (october 15, 2004) until october15, 2006, visa u.s.a. and visa international were required to permit any issuer with which they had entered into an agreement prior to the effective date of the final judgment, pursuant to which agreement the issuer committed to maintain a certain percentage of its general purpose card volume, new card issuance, or total number of cards in force in the united states on the visa network, to terminate that agreement without penalty, provided that the reason for the termination was to permit the issuer to enter into an agreement with american express or discover. the final judgment imposed parallel requirements on mastercard. visa u.s.a. and visa international appealed the judges ruling with respect to bylaw 2.10(e). on september17, 2003, a three-judge panel of the second circuit issued its decision upholding the district courts   5  schedule 5.7 decision. on october4, 2004, the supreme court denied visa u.s.a. and visa internationals petition for certiorari, thereby exhausting all avenues for further appeal in this case. the final judgment became effective by court order on october15, 2004. discover filed suit against visa u.s.a. and visa international in the u.s.district court for the southern district of new york alleging, among other things, that visa bylaw 2.10(e) and mastercards cpp caused it injury under the u.s. federal antitrust laws. in connection with its claim, discover requested that the district court give collateral estoppel effect to the district courts findings in the judgment of the 1998 doj litigation. see retrospective responsibility plancovered litigationthe discover litigation. american express filed a suit similar to the discover litigation against visa u.s.a., visa international and certain visa u.s.a. member financial institutions. we, visa u.s.a. and visa international entered into a settlement agreement with american express that became effective on november9, 2007. the settlement agreement in the american express litigation will be funded through our retrospective responsibility plan. see businessretrospective responsibility plancovered litigationthe american express litigation. on august17, 2007, discover moved the district court to intervene in the settlement service fee matter. discover also sought to have the district court modify its june15, 2007 order to (1)extend the contract termination remedy to issuers entering into agreements with discover; and (2)void certain provisions of visa u.s.a.s debit agreements. the court denied discovers motion on october12, 2007. on september11, 2007, discover filed a motion to intervene in the settlement service fee case in the second circuit and asked the second circuit to remand the case to the district court. visa u.s.a. opposed discovers motion. briefing is complete but no decision has been issued by the second circuit. global interchange proceedings interchange represents a transfer of value between the financial institutions participating in an open-loop payments network such as ours. on purchase transactions, interchange passes from acquirers to issuers, reflecting the costs issuers bear and the value they provide to the visa system by bringing cardholders into the visa system, guaranteeing payments, servicing accounts and performing other activities that support cardholder spending. in atm transactions, the situation is typically reversed and interchange fees pass from issuers to acquirers to offset the acquirers costs of atm deployment and the value they provide in establishing atm networks of attractive geographic scale and functionality. we establish default interchange rates, and our customers may choose to establish different rates for transactions among themselves. although we administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process, we generally do not receive any portion of the interchange fees. as described more fully below, our interchange rates and those of our customers are subject to regulatory or legal review and/or challenges in a number of jurisdictions. the increasing legal and regulatory scrutiny of interchange fees worldwide may have a material adverse impact on our revenues, our prospects for future growth and our overall business. united states. approximately 50 class action and individual complaints have been filed on behalf of merchants against visa u.s.a., visa international and certain visa u.s.a. member financial institutions alleging that their setting of interchange rates violates federal and state antitrust laws, among other antitrust allegations. the lawsuits have been transferred to a multidistrict litigation in the eastern district of new york. see retrospective responsibility plancovered litigationinterchange litigation. new zealand.the commerce commission, new zealands competition regulator, filed a civil statement of claim in the high court in wellington on november9, 2006, alleging that, among other things, the fixing of default interchange rates by cards nz limited, visa international, mastercard and certain visa international member financial institutions contravenes the new zealand commerce act.on november27, 2006, a group of new zealand retailers filed a nearly identical claim against the same parties before the same tribunal. both the commerce commission and the retailers seek declaratory, injunctive and monetary relief.on march2, 2007, visa international filed statements of defense in both cases, denying liability for any cause of action. both cases were transferred to the commercial list at the high court in auckland in april 2007, where the court is expected to set a timetable for further proceedings.   6  schedule 5.7 european union. on september29, 2000, the european commission issued a statement of objections challenging visa internationals cross-border eu default interchange rates under european community competition rules. on july24, 2002, the european commission announced its decision to exempt visa internationals default eu intra-regional/cross-border interchange rates from these rules based on certain changes to those rates proposed by visa europe. among other things, in connection with the exemption decision, visa europe agreed to set a cap on these default interchange rates using a benchmark cost-based methodology that considers certain issuer costs. visa europe also agreed to reduce its default interchange rates for debit and credit transactions to amounts at or below certain specified levels. this exemption expires on december31, 2007. on june13, 2005, the european commission announced a sector inquiry into the financial services industry, which includes an examination of a number of aspects of payment systems, including interchange fees. on january31, 2007, the european commission released its final report on its sector inquiry into the payment card industry. in the report, the european commission expresses concern about a large number of practices, including interchange fees and payment system rules, of a multiplicity of industry participants, and warns of possible regulatory proceedings or legislative action to address the concerns identified. however, the report does not indicate against which industry participants any such regulatory action might be taken or what legislative changes might be sought. united kingdom office of fair trading. on october19, 2005, the office of fair trading of the united kingdom, or the oft, issued a statement of objections against visa international, visa europe, visa uk and certain member financial institutions challenging the default interchange rates applicable to consumer credit card, charge card and deferred debit card transactions in the united kingdom. the statement of objections set out the ofts view that the default interchange fee may infringe the u.k.s competition act and article 81 of the e.c. treaty. in june 2006, the statement of objections was withdrawn. the oft has begun a new investigation into the visa entities u.k. domestic default interchange rates, among other things, although no formal proceedings have been initiated. other jurisdictions. we are aware that regulatory authorities and/or central banks in certain other jurisdictions, including brazil and colombia, are reviewing visa internationals and/or its members interchange fees and/or related practices and may seek to regulate the establishment of such fees and/or such practices. currency conversion litigation visa u.s.a. and visa international are defendants in a series of actions, described in more detail below, that challenge how the price of using visa-branded credit and/or debit/atm cards to make transactions in a foreign currency or foreign country was set and disclosed. these actions include claims relating to the 1% fee that visa u.s.a. and visa international formerly assessed on members on transactions in foreign currencies, and claims relating to how visa u.s.a. and visa international set their base exchange rate. these cases are described in more detail below. these matters have been settled, although the settlement approval process is still proceeding. the mdl action visa u.s.a., visa international, mastercard, citicorp diners club, inc., or diners club, and several visa u.s.a. and visa international member financial institutions, and in some cases their affiliates and parents, are defendants in a number of federal class actions that allege, among other things, violations of federal antitrust laws based on an asserted 1% currency conversion fee assessed on members by the payment card networks on transactions involving the purchase of goods or services in a foreign currency. pursuant to orders of the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation, the federal complaints have been consolidated or coordinated in mdl 1409 (in re currency conversion fee antitrust litigation), which we refer to as the mdl action, before judge william h. pauley iii in the u.s. district court for the southern district of new york. the operative pre-settlement complaint in the mdl action alleges two theories of antitrust conspiracy under section1 of the sherman act: (i)an alleged inter-association conspiracy among mastercard, together with its members, visa u.s.a. and visa international, together with their members, and diners club to fix currency conversion fees allegedly charged to cardholders of no less than 1% of the transaction amount and frequently more; and (ii)two alleged intra-association conspiracies, whereby each of visa u.s.a./visa international and mastercard is claimed separately to have conspired with its members to fix currency conversion fees allegedly charged to cardholders of no less than 1% of the transaction amount and to facilitate and encourage institutionand collectionof second tier currency conversion surcharges. visa u.s.a. and visa international deny the allegations in the complaint. the complaint also asserts claims against some of the non-visa defendants for violation of the federal truth in lending act and/or violation of the south dakota consumer protection statutes.   7  schedule 5.7 fact and expert discovery in this matter have closed. on november12, 2003 plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, which was granted on october15, 2004. on march9, 2005, judge pauley issued a decision on defendants motion to reconsider the class certification decision. the judge ruled that the arbitration provisions in the cardholder agreements of several member bank defendants are valid as to all of the defendants and stayed those cardholders claims pending arbitration. plaintiffs moved for further reconsideration, which was denied by judge pauley on june16, 2005. in addition, judge pauley ruled that some cardholders of citibank, jpmorgan chase& co., and, in a ruling dated december7, 2005, diners club, would not be required to arbitrate their claims. the 2005 rulings on class certification and arbitration were appealed, but the appeals are not currently under consideration. on july20, 2006, the parties entered into the settlement agreement discussed below under the currency conversion settlement agreements. the schwartz action visa u.s.a., visa international and mastercard are defendants in schwartz v. visa international corp. (sic), et al., superior court of the state of california, alameda county, case no.822404-4, which we refer to as the schwartz action, in which the plaintiff purports to be acting on behalf of the general public. the lawsuit alleges that visa u.s.a., visa international and mastercard wrongfully imposed an asserted 1% currency conversion fee on every credit card transaction by u.s. mastercard and visa cardholders involving the purchase of goods or services in a foreign currency, and that such alleged fee is supposedly unfair, unlawful, unconscionable and deceptive. plaintiff contends that defendants alleged acts violate californias unfair competition law, california business and professions code  17200 et seq. the schwartz action claims that the alleged fee grossly exceeds any costs the defendants might incur in connection with currency conversions relating to credit card purchase transactions made in foreign countries and is not properly disclosed to cardholders. visa u.s.a. and visa international deny these allegations. trial of the schwartz action commenced on may20, 2002 and concluded on november27, 2002. on april8, 2003, the trial court judge issued a final decision, finding that visa u.s.a.s and visa internationals currency conversion process does not violate the truth in lending act or regulations, nor is it unconscionably priced under california law. however, the judge found that the practice is deceptive under california law, and ordered that visa u.s.a. and visa international mandate that members disclose the currency conversion process to cardholders in cardholder agreements, applications, solicitations and monthly billing statements. the judge also ordered restitution to u.s. cardholders. the judge issued a decision on restitution on september19, 2003, which requires a traditional notice and claims process in which consumers have approximately six months to submit their claims. the court issued its final judgment on october31, 2003. visa u.s.a. and visa international appealed the judgment. the final judgment and restitution process were stayed pending this appeal. on august6, 2004, the court awarded plaintiffs attorneys fees in the amount of $28.2 million, half to be paid by mastercard and half by visa u.s.a. and visa international. visa u.s.a. and visa international subsequently filed a notice of appeal on the attorneys fee award. in february 2005, visa u.s.a. and visa international filed additional appellate briefing regarding the applicability of proposition 64, which amended sections of californias unfair competition law dealing with standing to bring claims on behalf of others, to this action. on september28, 2005, the appellate court reversed the trial court, finding that the plaintiff lacked standing to pursue the action in light of proposition 64. plaintiff filed a petition for review with the california supreme court on november7, 2005, which was granted on december14, 2005. on july20, 2006, the parties entered into the settlement agreement discussed below under the currency conversion settlement agreements. on march21, 2007, the california supreme court dismissed plaintiffs petition for review of the court of appeal decision reversing the trial courts judgment in favor of plaintiff. on march22, 2007, the california court of appeal remanded the action to the trial court. on april30, 2007, the california court of appeal dismissed the appeal and cross-appeals of the trial courts award of attorneys fees in this matter, and remanded these matters to the trial court. on may8, 2007, the trial court dismissed the schwartz action in its entirety without prejudice.   8  schedule 5.7 the shrieve action visa u.s.a., visa international and mastercard are defendants in a putative nationwide class action (statewide as to mastercard) in california state court, shrieve v. visa u.s.a. inc., et al., superior court for the state of california, alameda county, case no. rg04155097, which we refer to as the shrieve action. plaintiffs allege that defendants impose a hidden transaction fee of 1% on debit card transactions and atm withdrawals in foreign countries, and that defendants therefore violated californias unfair competition law. visa u.s.a. and visa international deny the allegations in plaintiffs complaint. following the passage of proposition 64, which limited standing to bring unfair competition law claims, visa u.s.a. and visa international moved for judgment on the pleadings. the court denied this motion. in january 2006, visa u.s.a. and visa international filed a writ petition with the court of appeal seeking review of this denial. in february 2006, plaintiffs moved in the trial court for certification of their action as a class. defendants have opposed this motion. while this writ petition and motion were pending, plaintiffs entered into the settlement agreement discussed below under the currency conversion settlement agreements, and further consideration of this action has been deferred until after the march31, 2008 final fairness hearing. the mattingly action visa u.s.a., visa international and mastercard are defendants in a putative nationwide class action (statewide as to mastercard), mattingly v. visa u.s.a. inc., et al., superior court for the state of california, alameda county, case no. rg05198142, the mattingly action. plaintiffs allege that defendants impose a hidden transaction fee of 1% on credit card transactions in foreign countries, and that defendants therefore violated californias unfair competition law. visa u.s.a. and visa international deny the allegations in plaintiffs complaint. in january 2006, plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint to change the start of their putative class period to february14, 2001 instead of october23, 2002. while this motion was pending, the parties entered into the mdl settlement agreement, and further consideration of this action has been deferred until after the march31, 2008 final fairness hearing discussed below under the currency conversion settlement agreements. the baker action visa u.s.a. and visa international are defendants in baker v. visa international corp. (sic), et al., 06-cv-15447 (s.d.n.y.), coordinated or consolidated with mdl 1409; formerly 06-cv-376 (s.d. cal.), originally filed in the superior court for the state of california, san diego county, case no. gic 839908, the baker action. plaintiffs in the baker action allege that visa u.s.a. and visa international impose a hidden mark-up included in the base exchange rate used to convert credit card transactions in foreign currencies. plaintiffs further allege that visa u.s.a. and visa internationals actions violate californias unfair competition law and the consumer legal remedies act and breached a fiduciary duty owed by visa u.s.a. and visa international to the members of plaintiffs putative world-wide class. visa u.s.a. and visa international deny the allegations in plaintiffs complaint. following the settlement of the baker action, discussed below under the currency conversion settlement agreements, the matter was transferred from the southern district of california to the southern district of new york, where it has been coordinated or consolidated with the mdl action. the currency conversion settlement agreements on july20, 2006, visa u.s.a. and visa international entered into a settlement in the mdl action. under the terms of that settlement, the defendants, which include visa u.s.a., visa international, mastercard, citicorp diners club inc. and several banks, will pay $336.0 million to settle monetary claims by eligible cardholders, the costs of administering the settlement and notice to cardholders, and any court-approved fees and expenses to attorneys for the class and awards to the class representatives. visa u.s.a. and visa internationals portion of the settlement payment, which has already been funded, is approximately $100.1 million. in addition, visa u.s.a. and visa international agreed that for five years they would separately identify or itemize any fees added to transactions because they occurred in a foreign country or involved a foreign currency. visa u.s.a. and visa international further agreed that if, within five years, they materially modify their current practices with regard to calculating the base exchange rate they use for foreign currency transactions and the new practices include the systematic use of   9  schedule 5.7 rates outside of a wholesale or government-mandated/managed rate, visa u.s.a. and visa international will require their issuing members in the united states to change their disclosures regarding base exchange rates to conform with the changed practices. as part of this settlement, plaintiffs in the shrieve action and the mattingly action agreed that they would ask the court to dismiss their actions with prejudice as to visa u.s.a. and visa international once the mdl settlement receives court approval. as part of this settlement, visa u.s.a., visa international and mastercard also agreed to pay $32.0 million in attorneys fees to resolve the schwartz action. visa u.s.a. and visa internationals portion of this payment is approximately $18.6 million, funded in september 2007. finally, visa u.s.a. and visa international entered into a settlement in the baker action. under the terms of this settlement agreement, the parties agreed to undertake their best efforts to secure certain changes to the notice of settlement to be provided to class members in the mdl action, and plaintiffs agreed not to object or otherwise oppose approval of the mdl settlement agreement. upon final approval of the mdl settlement agreement, plaintiffs shall seek to dismiss the baker action. if the baker action is dismissed, visa u.s.a. and visa international shall pay $1 million plus interest from september14, 2006 as attorneys fees and costs. if, however, within 60 days of final approval of the mdl settlement agreement, the baker action has still not been dismissed, visa u.s.a. and visa international shall pay $500,000 plus interest from september14, 2006 as attorneys fees and costs. on november8, 2006, the court in the mdl action issued an order preliminarily approving the mdl settlement agreement. among other things, this order created, for settlement purposes only, a settlement damages class consisting of holders of u.s. issued visa- or mastercard-branded credit and debit cards or diners club-branded credit cards who used their cards to make a foreign payment transaction between february10, 1996 and november8, 2006, the settlement damages class. the court also approved, for settlement purposes only, the settlement injunctive class, which contains all persons who held a u.s. issued visa- or mastercard-branded credit or debit card or diners club-branded credit card as of november8, 2006. charge cards are included in the definition of credit cards. on november14, 2006, bernd bildstein, plaintiff in bildstein v. mastercard international incorporated, no.03 civ. 9826 (s.d.n.y.), a case coordinated with the mdl action, filed a notice of appeal from the grant of preliminary approval. notice of the settlement began in 2007. in view of concerns raised by putative class members, the court appointed a special master to work with the parties to review and amend, as appropriate, the plan for class notice and distribution of the settlement fund and to determine whether the proposed settlement agreement is fair, adequate and reasonable with respect to all class members. the special master submitted his report on or about july10, 2007, and recommended that the plan for notice and distribution of the fund be modified. on august13, 2007, the court issued an order approving the claims procedure recommended by the special master. on september24, 2007, the court issued an order approving the revised notices, claim forms and settlement schedule submitted by the parties. revised notices and claim forms will be mailed to identified class members in late november, and a revised publication notice will run in late november and early december. class members will have until february14, 2008 to object to or opt-out of the settlement. the court moved the hearing on entry of final judgment and order of dismissal to march31, 2008. based upon the courts preliminary approval of the settlement of the mdl action and other developments, approximately $100.1 million has been paid into a settlement fund to resolve these claims against visa u.s.a. and visa international, and legal provision of approximately $20.0 million has been made for the remainder of the settlement in connection with these currency conversion cases. should the mdl settlement agreement not receive final court approval, or otherwise terminate, we anticipate that the parties in all of the currency conversion litigation actions would return to the status quo ante in their respective actions. morgan stanley dean witter/discover in august 2004, the european commission in brussels issued a statement of objections against visa international and visa europe alleging a breach of european competition law. the allegation arises from the visa international and visa europe rule (bylaw 2.12(b)) that makes certain designated competitors, including morgan stanley dean witter/discover, ineligible for membership. on october3, 2007, the european commission fined   10  schedule 5.7 visa international and visa europe 10.2million ($14.5 million) for infringing european union rules on restrictive business practices (article 81 of the ec treaty and article 53 of the eea agreement). pursuant to existing agreements, visa europe has acknowledged full responsibility for the defense of this action, including any fines that may be payable. parke on june27, 2005, a purported consumer and merchant class action was filed in california state court against visa u.s.a., visa international, mastercard, merrick bank and cardsystems solutions, inc. the complaint stems from a data-security breach at cardsystems, a payment card processor that handled visa and other payment brand transactions. the complaint alleges that visa u.s.a. and visa internationals failure to inform cardholders of the cardsystems breach in a timely manner constitutes an unlawful and/or unfair business practice under californias unfair competition law and violates californias statutory privacy-notice law. in august 2005, the court denied the plaintiffs application for a temporary restraining order, except with respect to the defendants retention of affected account-identifying information, and in september 2005 denied plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction. also in september 2005, the court dismissed the claims brought by the merchant class. on november18, 2005, the defendants answered the remaining claims. limited discovery occurred. cardsystems filed for bankruptcy in u.s. district court for the district of arizona in may 2006, staying the litigation as to it. the plaintiffs removed the case to u.s. district court for the northern district of california on august10, 2006, and then sought to transfer the case to federal court in arizona. visa u.s.a., visa international and mastercard moved for remand to state court. on october11, 2006, the court granted the defendants motion for remand and denied the plaintiffs motion to transfer the case. proceedings involving cardsystems continue in the bankruptcy court in arizona, and the california state court plaintiffs appear to be pursuing claims against cardsystems in that forum. the state court in california has not set discovery deadlines or a trial date. the parties are currently engaged in settlement negotiations. the potential settlement amount is not considered material to visa u.s.a.s financial statements. the atm exchange on november14, 2005, the atm exchange filed a complaint for money damages against visa u.s.a. and visa international in the u.s. district court for the southern district of ohio. the plaintiff asserts claims of promissory estoppel, negligent misrepresentation and fraudulent misrepresentation, alleging that visas deferment of a july1, 2004 member deadline that required newly deployed atms to be certified by a visa- recognized laboratory as meeting certain pin-entry device testing requirements harmed the plaintiff by reducing demand for its atm upgrade solution. the parties engaged in written discovery, party and third-party depositions and expert discovery. on june29, 2007, visa u.s.a. and visa international filed motions for summary judgment on liability and damages. on july30, 2007, the court vacated the tentative september 2007 trial date. the court indicated that it would set another trial date, if necessary, in its forthcoming ruling on the motions for summary judgment. intellectual property litigation starpay on may8, 2003, starpay.com, llc and vimachine, inc., which we refer to collectively as starpay, sued visa u.s.a. and visa international in the u.s. district court for the northern district of texas. starpay alleged that visa u.s.a. and visa international used information provided to it by starpay in 2000 to create verified by visa and to file a visa patent application on the technology underlying verified by visa, and that verified by visa infringed u.s. patent 5,903,878, entitled method and apparatus for electronic commerce, or the 878 patent. the original complaint alleged four causes of action: (1)infringement of the 878 patent; (2)breach of implied and written nondisclosure agreements covering starpays discussions with visa u.s.a. and visa international; (3)fraud on the patent office through the filing of a patent application for an invention that visa u.s.a. and visa international allegedly took from starpay; and (4)a claim under 35 u.s.c.  291 that the visa patent application interfered with the 878 patent. on july25, 2003, starpay filed an amended complaint, dropping the third and fourth causes of action, but raising two new ones in their place: unfair competition under californias business and professions code  17200 et seq. and misappropriation of trade secrets under californias uniform trade secrets act. on august25, 2003, visa u.s.a. and visa international moved to dismiss three of starpays causes of action. on february10, 2004, the district court judge dismissed the second claim under the statute of limitations and the third claim as preempted by federal patent law.   11  schedule 5.7 on february23, 2004, visa u.s.a. and visa international answered starpays remaining causes of actioninfringement of the 878 patent and misappropriation of trade secretsand filed a counterclaim for a declaratory judgment that visa u.s.a. and visa international are not infringing the 878 patent and/or that the 878 patent is invalid. on march16, 2004, starpay filed its answer to visa u.s.a. and visa internationals counterclaim. the magistrate judge held hearings on the issue of the construction of various claims of the 878 patent in october and november 2004 and in november 2005. on january19, 2006, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation making findings and recommendations. in february 2006, the parties filed their respective objections to the report with the district court judge. on september10, 2007, the district court issued an order resolving the parties various objections and finalized the claim construction. pursuant to an earlier order of the court, a schedule will now be set for the remainder of discovery, dispositive motions and trial. cryptography research visa international is a defendant in litigation filed in the north district of california by cryptography research, inc., or cri. cri has asserted causes of action against visa international for breach of contract, misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duties, infringement of eight u.s. patents and violation of u.s. and california competition laws. these causes of action are based upon cris allegations that visa international has improperly used, or induced others to use, technology allegedly developed by cri for securing smart cards against attacks designed to discover secret information, such as the secret key for performing cryptographic operations. in particular, cri alleges that visa international is and, at least since 1998, has been improperly using countermeasures to differential power analysis, or dpa, attacks that were developed by cri and which cri claims to own exclusively. cris original complaint was filed on september29, 2004, asserting claims for breach of contract, misrepresentation and for infringement of u.s. patent nos. 6,298,442, 6,304,658, 6,654,884, 6,327,661, 6,510,518, 6,381,699, 6,278,783 and 6,539,092, the patents in suit. in response to visa internationals motion to dismiss, the court ordered cri to file an amended complaint more specifically identifying its claims and the bases therefore. on march7, 2005, cri filed an amended complaint identifying claims for breach of contract, misrepresentation, fraud in the inducement and infringement of the eight patents in suit. the breach of contract, misrepresentation and fraud in the inducement claims stem from a september2, 1998 intellectual property license agreement between cri and visa international. the license agreement granted visa international worldwide rights to cris patent applications that ultimately matured into the patents in suit. the primary issue in both the breach of contract and misrepresentation claims is whether visa international was able to track, and in fact properly tracked, all issued visa-branded cards subject to the license and paid the resulting royalties. discovery in this matter is currently ongoing. a patent claims construction hearing was held on november8 and 9, 2005. on october19, 2006, the parties received the first of the eight pending claim construction orders, which construed the disputed terms in u.s. patent no.6,327,661. the court issued its second claims construction order on may4, 2007, which construed disputed terms of u.s. patent no.6,278,783 and modified one term construed by the first claims construction order. cri filed a motion for reconsideration of the second order, and a hearing on that motion was held september10, 2007. no ruling on cris motion has been issued. in the meantime, the court filed its third claim construction order on may22, 2007, which construed disputed terms in u.s. patent no.6,298,442, and its fourth claim construction order on september28, 2007, construing the terms of u.s. patent no.6,539,092. although we expect the court to rule on the remaining claims shortly, there is no deadline for the court to issue its ruling. the courts orders will be critical to determining which of visa products will continue to be relevant in this litigation. on march22, 2007, cri filed its second amended complaint, adding claims for breach of fiduciary duty and violation of section1 of the sherman act and californias unfair competition law. in particular, cri alleges that visa international and mastercard entered into three conspiracies in violation of section1 of the sherman act: (1)to refrain from competing with respect to the security from dpa attacks of their smart cards, which conspiracy allegedly began in 1998; (2)to boycott (jointly refuse to license) cris countermeasure patents; and (3)to boycott by removing cris dpa-resistant session key derivation system technology from the visa, mastercard and   12  schedule 5.7 emvco. specifications, the latter two of which conspiracies allegedly began in 2005 following this lawsuit. in addition, cri alleges that visa international has conspired with its smart card chip and card vendors to boycott cris countermeasure patents. cri further alleges that visa international is liable under californias cartwright act, bus.& prof. code sections 16720-70, and the california business& professions code  17200 et seq. visa international filed its answer to the second amended complaint and related counterclaims on april23, 2007. vale canjeable on november21, 2006, vale canjeable ticketven, c.a., filed an action in the fifth municipal court of caracas, venezuela against todoticket 2004, c.a., and visa international seeking a preliminary injunction preventing use of the visa vale mark in venezuela. in december 2006, vale canjeable ticketven, c.a. also filed a claim with the fourth commercial court of first instance of caracas, alleging that the defendants infringed the plaintiffs rights as the holder of the trademark registries and requesting that the court: (i)declare that the plaintiff is the only person authorized to use the expression vale in the venezuelan market of food vouchers; (ii)prohibit the defendants from using the expression vale in the venezuelan market of food vouchers; (iii)order the defendants to pay veb 50 billion ($23.3 million) in non-pecuniary (moral) damages; and (iv)order the defendants to indemnify the pecuniary damages caused to the plaintiff. the plaintiff also requested that the court order the defendants to pay the legal costs and expenses related to the judicial process. on november29, 2006, the fifth municipal court of caracas granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting use of the vale in the venezuelan market of food vouchers. on december6, 2006, visa international filed a constitutional objection to the courts ruling. the objection was dismissed on december19, 2006 by the fourth commercial court of first instance of caracas. visa international appealed this decision, which was denied in march 2007. on march21, 2007, defendants filed a motion with the fourth commercial court of first instance of caracas, seeking revocation of the preliminary injunction granted by the fifth municipal court of caracas. this motion was denied on july11, 2007. visa international immediately filed an appeal of this decision with the superior court. on july26, 2007, visa international made a request for the removal of the first instance judge from the case and such request was granted on september25, 2007. a new judge was assigned to finalize the discovery phase of the case. on november1, 2007, visa international filed its written conclusions explaining how the evidence collected during discovery supports its arguments. each party has eight days to contest the other parties written conclusions and the judge must issue a decision on the merits of the case by january 2008. privasys on june20, 2007, privasys, inc. filed a complaint in u.s. district court for the northern district of california against visa international and visa u.s.a for patent infringement. privasys alleges that visas contactless payment technology infringes u.s. patent no.7,195,154, which we refer to as the 154 patent), entitled method for generating customer secure card numbers. visa u.s.a. and visa international filed their respective answers and counterclaims on august21, 2007 alleging that visa did not infringe the 154 patent, that the 154 patent is invalid and that the patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct and prosecution laches. on september28, 2007, privasys filed a motion requesting leave to file an amended complaint adding j.p. morgan chase and wells fargo as defendants. visa u.s.a. and visa international opposed this motion on october26, 2007 and asked the court, in the alternative, to stay all proceedings against visa issuing financial institutions pending resolution of the issue of whether the visa technology infringes the privasys patent. retrospective responsibility plan visa u.s.a. and visa international are parties to certain legal proceedings that we refer to as the covered litigation. the retrospective responsibility plan is designed to address potential liability under the covered litigation. covered litigation means:     the discover litigation. discover financial services inc. v. visa u.s.a.

with banc of america securities llc and j.p. morgan securities inc., as joint lead arrangers and book runners (the lead arrangers); and (b) the notes dated as of the date hereof made by the borrower payable to the order of certain of the lenders (the notes). each capitalized term used and not defined herein has the meaning assigned to that term in the credit agreement. the credit agreement and the notes are collectively referred to herein as the loan documents. we have assumed with your permission that: (a) the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, all individuals executing such documents had all requisite legal capacity and competency and were duly authorized, the documents submitted to us as originals are authentic and the documents submitted to us as certified or reproduction copies conform to the originals; (b) each of the parties to the credit agreement has all requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the credit agreement (except that we have not assumed the borrowers corporate power and authority under delaware law to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the credit agreement), and the execution and delivery of the credit agreement by each party and the performance of such partys obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary action by such party (except that we have not assumed due authorization by the borrower);   1  exhibit a (c) the execution and delivery of the credit agreement by each party (other than the borrower) and the performance of each such

enforceable against it in accordance with its terms; (d) except for the fee letters, there are no agreements or understandings between or among the administrative agent, the syndication agent, the arrangers, the lenders (collectively, the lender parties), the borrower or third parties that would expand, modify or otherwise affect the terms of the loan documents or the respective rights or obligations of the parties thereunder; and in rendering this opinion, we have made such inquiries and examined, among other things, originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such records, agreements, certificates, instruments and other documents as we have considered necessary or appropriate for purposes of this opinion. as to certain factual matters, we have relied solely upon the representations and warranties of the borrower in the loan documents, certificates of officers of the borrower or certificates obtained from public officials. except as expressly stated otherwise herein, whenever an opinion herein with respect to the existence or absence of facts is stated to be to our knowledge, such statement is intended to signify that, during the course of our representation of the borrower, as herein described, no information has come to the attention of the lawyers currently with this law firm and working on the credit facility described in the loan documents that would give us actual knowledge of facts contrary to the existence or absence of the facts indicated. however, we have not undertaken any independent investigation to determine the existence or absence of such facts, and no inference as to our knowledge of the existence or absence of such facts should be drawn from our representation of the borrower or any affiliate thereof. based on the foregoing and in reliance thereon, and subject to the assumptions, exceptions, qualifications and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that: 1. the borrower is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of delaware and is qualified as a foreign corporation and in good standing in the state of california. 2. the execution and delivery by the borrower of the loan documents and the performance by the borrower of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action by the borrower and will not: (a) require any consent of the borrowers shareholders or members (other than any such consent as has already been given and remains in full force and effect); (b) violate (i)any law, rule or regulation of the states of new york and delaware or of any federal law of the united states or (ii)the borrowers certificate of incorporation or bylaws; (c) to our knowledge, violate (i)the provisions of any material indenture, instrument or agreement to which the borrower or any of its subsidiaries is a party or is subject, or by which it, or its property, is bound, or conflict with or constitute a default thereunder or (ii)any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award binding on the borrower or any of its subsidiaries; or   2  exhibit a (d) to our knowledge, result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any lien on the property of the borrower or a subsidiary pursuant to the terms of any material indenture, instrument or agreement binding upon the borrower or any of its subsidiaries. 3. the loan documents constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the borrower enforceable against the borrower in accordance with their terms. 4. except as disclosed in schedule 5.7 to the credit agreement, to our knowledge, there is no litigation, arbitration, governmental investigation, proceeding or inquiry pending or threatened against the borrower or any of its subsidiaries which, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect. 5. no order, consent, adjudication, approval, license, authorization or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, or exemption by, or other action in respect of any governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, which has not been obtained by the borrower or any of its subsidiaries, is required to be obtained by the borrower or any of its subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of the loan documents, the borrowings under the

waiver (whether or not stated as such) under the loan documents of, or any consent thereunder relating to, any unknown future rights or the rights of any party thereto existing, or duties owing to it, as a matter of law; (ii)the effectiveness of any waiver (whether or not stated as such) contained in the loan documents of rights of any party, or duties owing to it, that is broadly or vaguely stated

jurisdiction of any federal court; (vii)any waiver of the right to jury trial; (viii)any rights of setoff (other than such as are provided by section151 of the debtor and creditor law of the state of

than covenants relating to the payment of principal, interest, make whole premium, indemnities and expenses) to the extent they are construed to be independent requirements as distinguished from conditions to the declaration or occurrence of a default or any event of default; (xi)any waivers of any statute of limitations; (xii)any power of attorney granted under the loan documents; (xiii)any provision of any loan document purporting to establish evidentiary standards; (xiv)any provision of any loan document insofar as it provides for the payment or reimbursement of costs and expenses or

every right or remedy is cumulative and may be exercised in addition to any other right or remedy, that the election of some particular remedy does not preclude recourse to one or more others or that

suggests that oral or other modifications, amendments or waivers could not be effectively agreed upon by the parties or that the doctrine of promissory estoppel might not apply; (iii)purporting to waive obligations or standards of good faith, notice, diligence, reasonableness or care and similar applicable principles of common law and certain rights of debtors and duties of creditors which

provisions; or (viii)specifying that provisions of any loan document may only be waived in writing if an oral agreement or an implied agreement by trade practice or course of conduct has been created modifying any provision of any of such documents. e. we express no opinion with respect to the compliance by the borrower with, or any financial calculations or data in respect of, financial covenants included in the loan documents. furthermore, while we advise you that (subject to the other assumptions, exceptions, qualifications and limitations herein) the loan documents may be performed in a
