the cost of compliance with (a)the requirements of the bank of england and/or the financial services authority (or, in either case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) or (b)the requirements of the european central bank. the mandatory cost is not applicable to loans made in dollars. 2. on the first day of each interest period (or as soon as possible thereafter) the administrative agent shall calculate, as a percentage rate, a rate (the additional cost rate) for each lender, in accordance with the paragraphs set out below. the mandatory cost will be calculated by the administrative agent as a weighted average of the lenders additional cost rates (weighted in proportion to the percentage participation of each lender in the relevant loan) and will be expressed as a percentage rate per annum. 3. the additional cost rate for any lender lending from a facility office in a participating member state will be the percentage notified by that lender to the administrative agent. this percentage will be certified by that lender in its notice to the administrative agent to be its reasonable and good faith determination of the cost (expressed as a percentage of that lenders participation in all loans made from that facility office) of complying with the minimum reserve requirements of the european central bank in respect of loans made from that facility office. 4. the additional cost rate for any lender lending from a facility office in the united kingdom will be calculated by the administrative agent as follows:   (a) in relation to a bps denominated loan:  ab+c(bd)+ex0.01 100  (a+c)  per cent. per annum   (b) in relation to a loan in any currency other than british pounds sterling:  ex0.01 300  per cent. per annum. where:   a is the percentage of eligible liabilities (assuming these to be in excess of any stated minimum) which that lender is from time to time required to maintain as an interest free cash ratio deposit with the bank of england to comply with cash ratio requirements. schedule 1.01  b is the percentage rate of interest (excluding the mandatory cost and, if the loan is not paid when due, the additional rate of interest specified in section2.13(c)) payable for the relevant interest period on the loan.   c is the percentage (if any) of eligible liabilities which that lender is required from time to time to maintain as interest bearing special deposits with the bank of england.   d is the percentage rate per annum payable by the bank of england to the administrative agent on interest bearing special deposits.   e is designed to compensate lenders for amounts payable under the fees rules and is calculated by the administrative agent as being the average of the most recent rates of charge supplied by the reference banks to the administrative agent pursuant to paragraph 7 below and expressed in pounds per 1,000,000. 5. for the purposes of this schedule:   (a) eligible liabilities and special deposits have the meanings given to them from time to time under or pursuant to the bank of england act 1998 or (as may be appropriate) by the bank of england;   (b) facility office means the office or offices notified by a lender to the administrative agent in writing on or before the date it becomes a lender (or following that date, by not less than five business days written notice) as the office or offices through which it will perform its obligations under this agreement;   (c) fees rules means the rules on periodic fees contained in the fsa supervision manual or such other law or regulation as may be in force from time to time in respect of the payment of fees for the acceptance of deposits;   (d) fee tariffs means the fee tariffs specified in the fees rules under the activity group a.1 deposit acceptors (ignoring any minimum fee or zero rated fee required pursuant to the fees rules but taking into account any applicable discount rate); and   (e) tariff base has the meaning given to it in, and will be calculated in accordance with, the fees rules. 6. in application of the above formulae, a, b, c and d will be included in the formulae as percentages (i.e. 5per cent. will be included in the formula as 5 and not as 0.05). a negative result obtained by subtracting d from b shall be taken as zero. the resulting figures shall be rounded to four decimal places. schedule 1.01 7. if requested by the administrative agent, each reference bank shall, as soon as practicable after publication by the financial services authority, supply to the administrative agent, the rate of charge payable by that reference bank to the financial services authority pursuant to the fees rules in respect of the relevant financial year of the financial services authority (calculated for this purpose by that reference bank as being the average of the fee tariffs applicable to that reference bank for that financial year) and expressed in pounds per 1,000,000 of the tariff base of that reference bank. 8. each lender shall supply any information required by the administrative agent for the purpose of calculating its additional cost rate. in particular, but without limitation, each lender shall supply the following information on or prior to the date on which it becomes a lender: (a) the jurisdiction of its facility office; and (b) any other information that the administrative agent may reasonably require for such purpose. each lender shall promptly notify the administrative agent of any change to the information provided by it pursuant to this paragraph. 9. the percentages of each lender for the purpose of a and c above and the rates of charge of each reference bank for the purpose of e above shall be determined by the administrative agent based upon the information supplied to it pursuant to paragraphs 7 and 8 above and on the assumption that, unless a lender notifies the administrative agent to the contrary, each lenders obligations in relation to cash ratio deposits and special deposits are the same as those of a typical bank from its jurisdiction of incorporation with a facility office in the same jurisdiction as its facility office. 10. the administrative agent shall have no liability to any person if such determination results in an additional cost rate which over or under compensates any lender and shall be entitled to assume that the information provided by any lender or reference bank pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above is true and correct in all respects. 11. the administrative agent shall distribute the additional amounts received as a result of the mandatory cost to the lenders on the basis of the additional cost rate for each lender based on the information provided by each lender and each reference bank pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above. 12. any reasonable determination made by the administrative agent in good faith pursuant to this schedule in relation to a formula, the mandatory cost, an additional cost rate or any amount payable to a lender shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties. 13. the administrative agent may from time to time, after consultation with the applicable borrower and the lenders, determine and notify to all applicable loan parties any amendments which are required to be made to this schedule in order to comply with any change in law, regulation or any requirements from time to time imposed by the bank of england, the financial services authority or the european central bank (or, in any case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) and any such reasonable determination made in good faith shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties. schedule 1.01 reference banks means, in relation to the eurocurrency rate and mandatory cost the principal london offices of jpmorgan chase bank, london branch or such other banks as may be appointed by the administrative agent in consultation with the applicable borrower. schedule 1.01 schedule 3.08 real property owned or leased in the united states and united kingdom united kingdom  entity  address  property owned or leased
