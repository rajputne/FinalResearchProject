(vi) if any revolving lender fails to make available to the administrative agent for the account of the l/c issuer any amount required to be paid by such lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section2.03(c) by the time specified in section2.03(c)(ii), then, without limiting the other provisions of this agreement, the l/c issuer shall be entitled to recover from such lender (acting through the administrative agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the l/c issuer at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the federal funds rate and a rate determined by the l/c issuer in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the l/c issuer in connection with the foregoing. if such lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such lenders revolving loan included in the relevant borrowing or l/c advance in respect of the relevant l/c borrowing, as the case may be. a certificate of the l/c issuer submitted to any revolving lender (through the administrative agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi)shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(b) borrowing procedures. subject to the terms of any auto borrow agreement, each borrowing of swing line loans shall be made upon the borrowers irrevocable notice to the swing line lender and the administrative agent, which may be given by (a)telephone or (b)by a swing line loan notice; provided that any telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the swing line lender and the administrative agent of a swing line loan notice. each such notice must be received by the swing line lender and the administrative agent not later than 2:00 p.m. on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify (i)the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum principal amount of $100,000, (ii)the requested borrowing date, which shall be a business day and (iii)whether such swing line loan shall be a base rate loan or a quoted rate swing line loan. promptly after receipt by the swing line lender of any telephonic swing line loan notice, the swing line lender will confirm with the administrative agent (by telephone or in writing) that the administrative agent has also received such swing line loan notice and, if not, the swing line lender will notify the administrative agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof. unless the swing line lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the administrative agent (including at the request of any lender) prior to 3:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed borrowing of swing line loans (a)directing the swing line lender not to make such swing line loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the first proviso to the first sentence of section2.04(a), or (b)that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in article v is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the swing line lender will, not later than 3:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such swing line loan notice, make the amount of its swing line loan available to the borrower.

(ii) if for any reason any swing line loan cannot be refinanced by such a borrowing of revolving loans in accordance with section2.04(c)(i), the request for base rate loans submitted by the swing line lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the swing line lender that each of the revolving lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant swing line loan and each revolving lenders payment to the administrative agent for the account of the swing line lender pursuant to section2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation. (iii) if any revolving lender fails to make available to the administrative agent for the account of the swing line lender any amount required to be paid by such lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section2.04(c) by the time specified in section2.04(c)(i), the swing line lender shall be entitled to recover from such lender (acting through the administrative agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the swing line lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the federal funds rate and a rate determined by the swing line lender in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the swing line lender in connection with the foregoing. if such lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such lenders revolving loan included in the relevant borrowing or funded participation in the relevant swing line loan, as the case may be. a certificate of the swing line lender submitted to any revolving lender (through the administrative agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii)shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (iv) each revolving lenders obligation to make revolving loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in swing line loans pursuant to this section2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (a)any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such lender may have against the swing line lender, the borrower, any subsidiary or any other person for any reason whatsoever, (b)the occurrence or continuance of a default, or (c)any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each revolving lenders obligation to make revolving loans pursuant to this section2.04(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in section5.02. no such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the borrower to repay swing line loans, together with interest as provided herein. (d) repayment of participations. (i) at any time after any revolving lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a swing line loan, if the swing line lender receives any payment on account of such swing line loan, the swing line lender will distribute to such lender its applicable percentage (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such lenders risk participation was funded) thereof in the same funds as those received by the swing line lender.  45 (ii) if any payment received by the swing line lender in respect of principal or interest on any swing line loan is required to be returned by the swing line lender under any of the circumstances described in section11.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the swing line lender in its discretion), each revolving lender shall pay to the swing line lender its applicable percentage thereof on demand of the administrative agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the federal funds rate. the administrative agent will make such demand upon the request of the swing line lender. the obligations of the revolving lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the obligations and the termination of this agreement. (e) interest for account of swing line lender. the swing line lender shall be responsible for invoicing the borrower for interest on the swing line loans. until each revolving lender funds its revolving loans that are base rate loans or risk participation pursuant to this section2.04 to refinance such lenders applicable percentage of any swing line loan, interest in respect of such applicable percentage shall be solely for the account of the swing line lender. (f) payments directly to swing line lender. the borrower shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the swing line loans directly to the swing line lender. (g) auto borrow arrangement. in order to facilitate the borrowing of swing line loans, the borrower and the swing line lender may mutually agree to, and are hereby authorized to, enter into an auto borrow agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the borrower, administrative agent and the swing line lender (the auto borrow agreement) providing for the automatic advance by the swing line lender of swing line loans under the conditions set forth in the auto borrow agreement, subject to the conditions set forth herein.at any time an auto borrow agreement is in effect, borrowings of swing line loans may be made in accordance with the auto borrow agreement.for purposes of determining the total revolving outstandings at any time during which an auto borrow agreement is in effect, the outstanding amount of all swing line loans shall be deemed to be the sum of the outstanding amount of swing line loans at such time plus the maximum amount available to be borrowed under such auto borrow agreement at such time. notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the borrower shall be permitted to amend or terminate the auto borrow agreement at any time without notice to or consent of the administrative agent or the lenders (but subject to any amendment or termination requirements set forth in the auto borrow agreement). 2.05 prepayments.

(b) discounted optional prepayments. (i) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement (including section2.05(a), section2.12(a) or section2.13), the borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay the term loan at a discount to the par value of the term loan and on a non pro rata basis (each a discounted optional prepayment); provided that (a) no default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result from such discounted optional prepayment; (b) no discounted optional prepayment shall be made with the proceeds of any revolving loan; (c) such discounted optional prepayment shall be offered to all lenders holding the term loan on a pro rata basis (it being understood that the determination by a lender that holds a portion of the term loan whether to accept such offer shall be in such lenders sole discretion); (d) the borrower shall deliver to the administrative agent a certificate stating that at the time of such discounted optional prepayment the borrower does not have any material non-public information (mnpi) that either (x)has not been disclosed  47 to the lenders (other than those which have elected not to receive such mnpi) prior to such time or (y)would reasonably be expected to have a material effect upon, or otherwise be material to, the market price of the term loan or a lenders decision to participate in such discounted optional prepayment; (e) the undiscounted aggregate principal amount of the term loan prepaid with discounted optional prepayments during the term of this agreement shall not exceed $100 million; and (f) after giving effect to such discounted optional prepayment, there shall be at least $50 million of liquidity.

(v) each discounted optional prepayment shall be made within four business days of the acceptance date (or such other date as the administrative agent shall reasonably agree, given the time required to calculate the applicable discount and determine the amount and holders of qualifying loans), without premium or penalty (but subject to section3.05), upon irrevocable notice (provided that such notice may be conditioned on receiving proceeds from any refinancing (but shall remain subject to section3.05)) substantially in the form of exhibit 2.05-3 hereto (each a notice of discounted prepayment), delivered to the administrative agent no later than 11:00 a.m. three business days prior to the date of such discounted optional prepayment, which notice shall specify the date and amount of the discounted optional prepayment and the applicable discount determined by the administrative agent. upon receipt of any notice of discounted prepayment the administrative agent shall promptly notify each relevant lender thereof. if any notice of discounted prepayment is given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable to the applicable lenders, subject to the applicable discount on the term loan, on the date specified therein together with accrued interest (on the par principal amount) to but not including such date on the amount prepaid. (vi) to the extent not expressly provided for herein, each discounted optional prepayment shall be consummated pursuant to reasonable procedures (including as to timing, rounding and calculation of applicable discount in accordance with section2.05(b)(iii)) established by the administrative agent in consultation with the borrower. (vii) following a discounted optional prepayment, no interest shall accrue from and after the applicable prepayment date on the term loan purchased by the borrower on such date and such purchased term loan shall be deemed cancelled or retired for all purposes and no longer outstanding (and may not be resold by the borrower) for all purposes of this agreement and all other loan documents (notwithstanding any provisions herein or therein to the contrary), including (a)the making of, or the application of, any payments to the lenders under this agreement or any other loan document, (b)the making of any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver under this agreement or any other loan document, (c)the providing of any rights to the borrower as a lender under this agreement or any other loan document and (d)the determination of required lenders.  49 (c) mandatory prepayments of loans.

(a) the credit extensions made by each lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such lender and by the administrative agent in the ordinary course of business. the accounts or records maintained by the administrative agent and each lender shall be prima facie evidence absent manifest error of the amount of the credit extensions made by the lenders to the borrower and the interest and payments thereon. any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the obligations. in the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any lender and the accounts and records of the administrative agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the administrative agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. upon the request of any lender made through the administrative agent, the borrower shall execute and deliver to such lender (through the administrative agent) a promissory note, which shall evidence such lenders loans in addition to such accounts or records. each such promissory note shall be in the form of exhibit 2.11 (a note). each lender may attach schedules to its note and endorse thereon the date, type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its loans and payments with respect thereto. (b) in addition to the accounts and records referred to in subsection (a), each lender and the administrative agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such lender of participations in letters of credit and swing line loans. in the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the administrative agent and the accounts and records of any lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the administrative agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. 2.12 payments generally; administrative agents clawback. (a) general. all payments to be made by the borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the borrower hereunder shall be made to the administrative agent, for the account of the respective lenders to which such payment is owed, at the administrative agents office in dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. the administrative agent will promptly distribute to each lender its applicable percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such lenders lending office. all payments received by the administrative agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding business day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. if any payment to be made by the borrower shall come due on a day other than a business day, payment shall be made on the next following business day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be. (b) (i) funding by lenders; presumption by administrative agent. unless the administrative agent shall have received notice from a lender prior to the proposed date of any borrowing of eurodollar rate loans (or, in the case of any borrowing of base rate loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such borrowing) that such lender will not make available to the administrative agent such lenders share of such borrowing, the administrative agent may assume that such lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with section 2.02  54 (or, in the case of a borrowing of base rate loans, that such lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by section2.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the borrower a corresponding amount. in such event, if a lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable borrowing available to the administrative agent, then the applicable lender and the borrower severally agree to pay to the administrative agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the administrative agent, at (a)in the case of a payment to be made by such lender, the greater of the federal funds rate and a rate determined by the administrative agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the administrative agent in connection with the foregoing, and (b)in the case of a payment to be made by the borrower, the interest rate applicable to base rate loans. if the borrower and such lender shall pay such interest to the administrative agent for the same or an overlapping period, the administrative agent shall promptly remit to the borrower the amount of such interest paid by the borrower for such period. if such lender pays its share of the applicable borrowing to the administrative agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such lenders loan included in such borrowing. any payment by the borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the borrower may have against a lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the administrative agent. (ii) payments by borrower; presumptions by administrative agent. unless the administrative agent shall have received notice from the borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the administrative agent for the account of the lenders or the l/c issuer hereunder that the borrower will not make such payment, the administrative agent may assume that the borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the lenders or the l/c issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. in such event, if the borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the lenders or the l/c issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the administrative agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such lender or the l/c issuer, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the administrative agent, at the greater of the federal funds rate and a rate determined by the administrative agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. a notice of the administrative agent to any lender or the borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b)shall be presumptively correct, absent manifest error. (c) failure to satisfy conditions precedent. if any lender makes available to the administrative agent funds for any loan to be made by such lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this article ii, and such funds are not made available to the borrower by the administrative agent because the conditions to the applicable credit extension set forth in article v are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the administrative agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such lender) to such lender, without interest. (d) obligations of lenders several. the obligations of the lenders hereunder to make loans, to fund participations in letters of credit and swing line loans and to make payments pursuant to section11.04(c) are several and not joint. the failure of any lender to make any loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under section11.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other lender to so make its loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under section11.04(c).  55 (e) funding source. nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any lender to obtain the funds for any loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any loan in any particular place or manner. 2.13 sharing of payments by lenders. except as otherwise contemplated herein, if any lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the loans made by it, or the participations in l/c obligations or in swing line loans held by it resulting in such lenders receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a)notify the administrative agent of such fact, and (b)purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the loans and subparticipations in l/c obligations and swing line loans of the other lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective loans and other amounts owing them, provided that: (i) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and (ii) the provisions of this section shall not be construed to apply to (a)any payment made by or on behalf of the borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a defaulting lender), (b)the application of cash collateral provided for in section2.14 or (c)any payment obtained by a lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its loans or subparticipations in l/c obligations or swing line loans to any assignee or participant, other than an assignment to the borrower or any subsidiary (as to which the provisions of this section shall apply). each loan party agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such loan party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such lender were a direct creditor of such loan party in the amount of such participation. 2.14 cash collateral. (a) certain credit support events. if (i)the l/c issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any letter of credit and such drawing has resulted in an l/c borrowing, (ii)as of the maturity date, any l/c obligation for any reason remains outstanding, (iii)the borrower shall be required to provide cash collateral pursuant to section9.02(c) or (iv)there shall exist a defaulting lender, the borrower shall immediately (in the case of clause (iii)above) or within one business day (in all other cases) following any request by the administrative agent or the l/c issuer provide cash collateral in an amount not less than the applicable minimum collateral amount (determined in the case of cash collateral provided pursuant to clause (iv)above, after giving effect to section2.15(a)(iv) and any cash collateral provided by the defaulting lender).  56 (b) grant of security interest. the borrower, and to the extent provided by any defaulting lender, such defaulting lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) the administrative agent, for the benefit of the administrative agent, the l/c issuer and the lenders, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such cash collateral may be applied pursuant to section2.14(c). if at any time the administrative agent determines that cash collateral is subject to any right or claim of any person other than the administrative agent or the l/c issuer as herein provided (other than liens permitted under section8.01(m)), or that the total amount of such cash collateral is less than the minimum collateral amount, the borrower or the relevant defaulting lender will, promptly upon demand by the administrative agent, pay or provide to the administrative agent additional cash collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency. all cash collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at the administrative agent or with another financial institution acceptable to the borrower and the administrative agent. the borrower shall pay on demand therefor from time to time all customary account opening, activity and other administrative fees and charges in connection with the maintenance and disbursement of cash collateral. (c) application. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, cash collateral provided under any of this section2.14 or sections 2.03, 2.05, 2.15 or 9.02 in respect of letters of credit shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific l/c obligations, obligations to fund participations therein (including, as to cash collateral provided by a defaulting lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the cash collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein. (d) release. cash collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce fronting exposure or to secure other obligations shall be released promptly following (i)the elimination of the applicable fronting exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of defaulting lender status of the applicable lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with section11.06(b)(vi))) or (ii)the good faith determination by the administrative agent and the l/c issuer that there exists excess cash collateral; provided, however, (x)any such release shall be without prejudice to, and any disbursement or other transfer of cash collateral shall be and remain subject to, any other lien conferred under the loan documents and the other applicable provisions of the loan documents, and (y)the person providing cash collateral and the l/c issuer may agree that cash collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated fronting exposure or other obligations. 2.15 defaulting lenders. (a) adjustments. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, if any lender becomes a defaulting lender, then, until such time as that lender is no longer a defaulting lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law: (i) waivers and amendments. such defaulting lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of required lenders and section11.01. (ii) defaulting lender waterfall. any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the administrative agent for the account of such defaulting lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to article ix or otherwise) or received by the administrative agent from a defaulting lender pursuant to section11.08 shall be applied at  57 such time or times as may be determined by the administrative agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such defaulting lender to the administrative agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such defaulting lender to the l/c issuer or swing line lender hereunder; third, to cash collateralize the l/c issuers fronting exposure with respect to such defaulting lender in accordance with section2.14; fourth, as the borrower may request (so long as no default exists), to the funding of any loan in respect of which such defaulting lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this agreement, as determined by the administrative agent; fifth, if so determined by the administrative agent and the borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x)satisfy such defaulting lenders potential future funding obligations with respect to loans under this agreement and (y)cash collateralize the l/c issuers future fronting exposure with respect to such defaulting lender with respect to future letters of credit issued under this agreement, in accordance with section2.14; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the lenders, the l/c issuer or swing line lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any lender, the l/c issuer or the swing line lender against such defaulting lender as a result of such defaulting lenders breach of its obligations under this agreement; seventh, so long as no event of default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the borrower against such defaulting lender as a result of such defaulting lenders breach of its obligations under this agreement; and eighth, to such defaulting lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x)such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any loans or l/c borrowings in respect of which such defaulting lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y)such loans were made or the related letters of credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in section5.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the loans of, and l/c obligations owed to, all non-defaulting lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any loans of, or l/c obligations owed to, such defaultinglender until such time as all loans and funded and unfunded participations in l/c obligations and swing line loans are held by the lenders pro rata in accordance with the commitments hereunder without giving effect to section2.15(a)(iv). any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a defaulting lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owedby a defaulting lender or to post cash collateral pursuant to this section2.15(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such defaulting lender, and each lender irrevocably consents hereto. (iii) certain fees. (1) no defaulting lender shall be entitled to receive any fee payable under section2.09(a) for any period during which that lender is a defaulting lender (and the borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that defaulting lender for any period during which that lender is a defaulting lender). (2) each defaulting lender shall be entitled to receive letter of credit fees for any period during which that lender is a defaulting lender only to the extent allocable to its applicable percentage of the stated amount of letters of credit for which it has provided cash collateral pursuant to section2.14. (3) with respect to any letter of credit fee not required to be paid to any defaulting lender pursuant to clause (b)above, the borrower shall (x)pay to each non-defaulting lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such defaulting lender with respect to such defaulting lenders participation in l/c obligations that has  58 been reallocated to such non-defaulting lender pursuant to clause (b)below, (y)pay to the l/c issuer the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such defaulting lender to the extent allocable to such l/c issuers fronting exposure to such defaulting lender, and (z)not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee. (iv) reallocation of applicable percentages to reduce fronting exposure. all or any part of such defaulting lenders participation in l/c obligations and swing line loans shall be reallocated among the non-defaulting lenders in accordance with their respective applicable percentages (calculated without regard to such defaulting lenders commitment) but only to the extent that such reallocation does not cause the aggregate revolving credit exposure of any non-defaulting lender to exceed such non-defaulting lenders commitment. no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a defaulting lender arising from that lender having become a defaulting lender, including any claim of a non-defaulting lender as a result of such non-defaulting lenders increased exposure following such reallocation. (v) termination of defaulting lender commitment. the borrower may, with the prior written consent of the administrative agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), terminate the unused amount of the revolving commitment of a defaulting lender upon not less than three business days prior notice to the administrative agent (which will promptly notify the lenders thereof), and in such event the provisions of section2.15(a)(ii) will apply to all amounts thereafter paid by the borrower for the account of such defaulting lender that is a lender under this agreement (in each case whether on account of principal, interest, fees or other amounts), provided that such termination will not be deemed to be a waiver or release of any claim the borrower, the administrative agent, the l/c issuer, the swing line lender or any lender may have against such defaulting lender. (vii) cash collateral, repayment of swing line loans. if the reallocation described in clause (a)(iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under applicable law, (x)first, prepay swing line loans in an amount equal to the swing line lenders fronting exposure and (y)second, cash collateralize the l/c issuers fronting exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in section2.14. (b) defaulting lender cure. if the borrower, the administrative agent, the swing line lender and the l/c issuer agree in writing that a lender is no longer a defaulting lender, the administrative agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any cash collateral), that lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding loans of the other lenders or take such other actions as the administrative agent may determine to be necessary to cause the loans and funded and unfunded participations in letters of credit and swing line loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the lenders in accordance with their applicable percentages (without giving effect to section2.15(a)(iv)), whereupon such lender will cease to be a defaulting lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the borrower while that lender was a defaulting lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from defaulting lender to lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that lenders having been a defaulting lender.  59 2.16 incremental facilities; extensions.

(x) in the case of an incremental revolving facility: (a) the final maturity of such incremental revolving facility shall not be earlier than the latest maturity date of the other revolving facilities; (b) such incremental revolving facility shall not be subject to any scheduled principal amortization payments or scheduled or mandatory commitment reductions prior to the latest maturity date of the other revolving facilities;

and  61 (d) such incremental revolving facility shall have ratable voting rights as the other revolving facilities (or otherwise provide for more favorable voting rights for the then outstanding revolving facilities); (xi) in the case of an incremental revolving increase with respect to a revolving facility, such incremental revolving increase shall be on the exact same terms and pursuant to the exact same documentation applicable to such revolving facility; and (xii) subject to the foregoing clauses, the interest rate margins, final maturity date and weighted average life to maturity applicable to any incremental revolving facility or incremental term facility shall be determined by the borrower and the persons providing such incremental revolving facility or incremental term facility thereunder. the incremental facility commitments and credit extensions thereunder shall constitute commitments and credit extensions under, and shall be entitled to all the benefits afforded by, this agreement and the other loan documents, and shall, without limiting the foregoing, benefit equally and ratably from the guarantees and security interests created by the collateral documents. the lenders hereby authorize the administrative agent to enter into, and the lenders agree that this agreement and the other loan documents shall be amended by, such incremental facility amendments to the extent (and only to the extent) the administrative agent deems necessary in order to establish incremental facilities on terms consistent with and/or to effect the provisions of this section2.16. the administrative agent shall promptly notify each lender as to the effectiveness of each incremental facility amendment. in addition, if so provided in the incremental facility amendment for an incremental revolving facility and with the consent of each l/c issuer, participation in letters of credit under the existing revolving facilities shall be reallocated from lenders holding revolving commitments under the existing revolving facilities to lenders holding revolving commitments under such incremental revolving facility in accordance with the terms of such incremental facility amendment. (b) the borrower may, by written notice to the administrative agent from time to time (and with the consent of the administrative agent, not to be unreasonably withheld), make one or more offers (each, a loan modification offer) to all the revolving lenders or all of the lenders holding the term loan to make one or more amendments or modifications to (i)allow the maturity and scheduled amortization (if any) of the loans of the accepting lenders to be extended and (ii)increase the applicable rate and/or fees payable with respect to the loans and commitments (if any) of the accepting lenders (permitted amendments) pursuant to procedures reasonably specified by the administrative agent and reasonably acceptable to the borrower. such notice shall set forth (i)the terms and conditions of the requested permitted amendment and (ii)the date on which such permitted amendment is requested to become effective. permitted amendments shall become effective only with respect to the loans and/or commitments of the lenders that accept the applicable loan modification offer (such lenders, the accepting lenders) and, in the case of any accepting lender, only with respect to such lenders loans and/or commitments as to which such lenders acceptance has been made. the borrower, each other loan party and each accepting lender shall execute and deliver to the administrative agent such documentation (a loan amendment) as the administrative agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the acceptance of the permitted amendments and the terms and conditions thereof, and the loan parties shall also deliver such corporate resolutions, opinions and other documents as reasonably requested by the administrative agent. the administrative agent shall promptly notify each lender as to the effectiveness of each loan amendment. each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that (i)upon the effectiveness of any loan amendment, this agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent (but only  62 to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the permitted amendment evidenced thereby and only with respect to the loans and commitments of the accepting lenders as to which such lenders acceptance has been made and (ii)any applicable lender who is not an accepting lender may be replaced by the borrower in accordance with section11.13. article iii taxes, yield protection and illegality 3.01 taxes.

(ii) without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the borrower is a resident for tax purposes in the united states (a) any lender that is a united states person within the meaning of section7701(a)(30) of the internal revenuecode shall deliver, on or before the date it becomes a party to this agreement, to the borrower and the administrative agent executed copies (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) of internal revenueservice form w-9 or such other documentation or information prescribed by applicable laws or reasonably requested by the borrower or the administrative agent as will enable the borrower or the administrative agent, as the case may be, to determine whether or not such lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements; and (b) each foreign lender that is entitled under the internal revenue code or any applicable treaty to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments hereunder or under any other loan document shall deliver to the borrower and the administrative agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such foreign lender becomes a lender under this agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the borrower or the administrative agent, but only if such foreign lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable: (i) executed copies of internal revenue service form w-8ben or w-8ben-e, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the united states is a party, (ii) executed copies of internal revenue service form w-8eci, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, (iii) executed copies of internal revenue service form w-8imy, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, and all required supporting documentation, (iv) in the case of a foreign lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section881(c) of the internal revenue code, (x)a certificate to the effect that such foreign lender is not (a)a bank within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(a) of the internal revenue code, (b)a 10 percent shareholder of the borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(b) of the internal revenue code, or (c)a controlled foreign corporation described in section 881(c)(3)(c) of the internal revenue code and (y) executed copies of internal revenue service form w-8ben or w-8ben-e, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, or  65 (v) executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable laws as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in united states federal withholding tax together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable laws to permit the borrower or the administrative agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.

(f) treatment of certain refunds. unless required by applicable laws, at no time shall the administrative agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a lender or the l/c issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any lender or the l/c issuer, any refund of taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such lender or the l/c issuer, as the case may be. if the administrative agent, any lender or the l/c issuer determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any taxes or other taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any loan party or with respect to which any loan party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this section, it shall pay to such loan party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity

other charges imposed by the relevant governmental authority) to the administrative agent, such lender or the l/c issuer in the event the administrative agent, such lender or the l/c issuer is required to repay such refund to such governmental authority. this subsection shall not be construed to require the administrative agent, any lender or the l/c issuer to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the borrower, any subsidiary or any other person.  66 3.02 illegality. if any lender reasonably determines that any law has made it unlawful, or that any governmental authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain or fund loans whose interest is determined by reference to the eurodollar rate or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the eurodollar rate, or any governmental authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, dollars in the london interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such lender to the borrower through the administrative agent, (a)any obligation of such lender to issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest with respect to any such credit extension or continue eurodollar rate loans or to convert base rate loans to eurodollar rate loans shall be suspended and (b)if such notice asserts the illegality of such lender making or maintaining base rate loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the eurodollar rate component of the base rate, the interest rate on which base rate loans of such lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the administrative agent without reference to the eurodollar rate component of the base rate, in each case until such lender notifies the administrative agent and the borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. upon receipt of such notice, (x)the borrower shall, upon demand from such lender (with a copy to the administrative agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all of such lenders eurodollar rate loans to base rate loans (the interest rate on which base rate loans of such lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the administrative agent without reference to the eurodollar rate component of the base rate), either on the last day of the interest period therefor, if such lender may lawfully continue to maintain such eurodollar rate loans to such day, or promptly, if such lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such eurodollar rate loans and (y)if such notice asserts the illegality of such lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the eurodollar rate, the administrative agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the base rate applicable to such lender without reference to the eurodollar rate component thereof until the administrative agent is advised in writing by such lender that it is no longer illegal for such lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the eurodollar rate. upon any such prepayment or conversion, the borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. 3.03 inability to determine rates. if in connection with any request for a eurodollar rate loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof (a)the administrative agent determines that (i)dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the london interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and interest period of such eurodollar rate loan or (ii)adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the eurodollar rate for any requested interest period with respect to a proposed eurodollar rate loan or in connection with an existing or proposed base rate loan (in each case with respect to clause (a)above, impacted loans) or (b)the administrative agent or the required lenders determine that for any reason the eurodollar rate for any requested interest period with respect to a proposed eurodollar rate loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such lenders of funding such eurodollar rate loan, the administrative agent will promptly so notify the borrower and each lender. thereafter, (x)the obligation of the lenders to make or maintain eurodollar rate loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected eurodollar rate loans or interest periods) and (y)in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the eurodollar rate component of the base rate, the utilization of the eurodollar rate component in determining the base rate shall be suspended, in each case until the administrative agent upon the instruction of the required lenders revokes such notice. upon receipt of such notice, the borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of eurodollar rate loans (to the extent of the affected eurodollar rate loans or interest periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a borrowing of base rate loans in the amount specified therein.  67 notwithstanding the foregoing, if the administrative agent has made the determination described in clause (a)of the first sentence of this section, the administrative agent, in consultation with the borrower and the affected lenders, may establish an alternative interest rate for the impacted loans, in which case, such alternative rate of interest shall apply with respect to the impacted loans until (1)the administrative agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the impacted loans under clause (a)of the first sentence of this section, (2)the administrative agent notifies the borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such lenders of funding the impacted loans, or (3)any lender determines that any law has made it unlawful, or that any governmental authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain or fund loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any governmental authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the administrative agent and the borrower written notice thereof. 3.04 increased costs; reserves on eurodollar rate loans. (a) increased costs generally. if any change in law shall: (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the eurodollar rate) or the l/c issuer; (ii) subject any lender or the l/c issuer to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this agreement, any letter of credit, any participation in a letter of credit or any eurodollar rate loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such lender or the l/c issuer in respect thereof (except for indemnified taxes or other taxes covered by section3.01 and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any excluded tax payable by such lender or the l/c issuer); or (iii) impose on any lender or the l/c issuer or the london interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this agreement or eurodollar rate loans made by such lender or any letter of credit or participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such lender of making or maintaining any loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the eurodollar rate (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such loan), or to increase the cost to such lender or the l/c issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any letter of credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any letter of credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such lender or the l/c issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such lender or the l/c issuer, the borrower will pay to such lender or the l/c issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such lender or the l/c issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. (b) capital requirements. if any lender or the l/c issuer determines that any change in law affecting such lender or the l/c issuer or any lending office of such lender or such lenders or the l/c issuers holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such lenders or the l/c issuers capital or on the capital of such lenders or the l/c issuers holding company, if any, as a consequence of this agreement, the  68 commitments of such lender or the loans made by, or participations in letters of credit held by, such lender, or the letters of credit issued by the l/c issuer, to a level below that which such lender or the l/c issuer or such lenders or the l/c issuers holding company could have achieved but for such change in law (taking into consideration such lenders or the l/c issuers policies and the policies of such lenders or the l/c issuers holding company with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity), then from time to time the borrower will pay to such lender or the l/c issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such lender or the l/c issuer or such lenders or the l/c issuers holding company for any such reduction actually suffered. (c) certificates for reimbursement. a certificate of a lender or the l/c issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such lender or the l/c issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a)or (b)of this section and delivered to the borrower shall be presumptively correct absent manifest error. the borrower shall pay such lender or the l/c issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 15 days after receipt thereof. (d) delay in requests. failure or delay on the part of any lender or the l/c issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section shall not constitute a waiver of such lenders or the l/c issuers right to demand such compensation, provided that the borrower shall not be required to compensate a lender or the l/c issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that such lender or the l/c issuer, as the case may be, notifies the borrower of the change in law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such lenders or the l/c issuers intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the change in law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). (e) reserves on eurodollar rate loans. the borrower shall pay to each lender, as long as such lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as eurocurrency liabilities), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each eurodollar rate loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such loan by such lender (as determined by such lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such loan, provided the borrower shall have received at least ten (10)days prior notice (with a copy to the administrative agent) of such additional interest or costs from such lender. if a lender fails to give notice ten (10)days prior to the relevant interest payment date, such additional interest shall be due and payable ten (10)days from receipt of such notice. 3.05 compensation for losses. promptly following demand of any lender (with a copy to the administrative agent) accompanied by the certificate referred to below from time to time, the borrower shall promptly compensate such lender for and hold such lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of: (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any eurodollar rate loan on a day other than the last day of the interest period for such loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); (b) any failure by the borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such lender to make a loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any eurodollar rate loan on the date or in the amount notified by the borrower; or  69 (c) any assignment of a eurodollar rate loan on a day other than the last day of the interest period therefor as a result of a request by the borrower pursuant to section11.13; including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. the borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such lender in connection with the foregoing. for purposes of calculating amounts payable by the borrower to the lenders under this section3.05, each lender shall be deemed to have funded each eurodollar rate loan made by it at the eurodollar rate used in determining the eurodollar rate for such loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the london interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such eurodollar rate loan was in fact so funded. concurrent with a demand for compensation pursuant to this section3.05, the lender making such demand shall deliver to the borrower (with a copy to the administrative agent) a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such lenders claim for compensation. such certificate shall be presumptively correct absent manifest error. 3.06 mitigation of obligations; replacement of lenders. (a) designation of a different lending office. each lender may make any credit extension to the borrower through any lending office, provided that the exercise of this option shall not affect the obligation of the borrower to repay the credit extension in accordance with the terms of this agreement. if any lender requests compensation under section3.04, or the borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any lender, the l/c issuer, or any governmental authority for the account of any lender or the l/c issuer pursuant to section3.01, or if any lender gives a notice pursuant to section3.02, then such lender or the l/c issuer shall, as applicable, use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such lender or the l/c issuer, such designation or assignment (i)would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to section3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to section3.02, as applicable, and (ii)in each case, would not subject such lender or the l/c issuer, as the case may be, to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such lender or the l/c issuer, as the case may be. the borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any lender or the l/c issuer in connection with any such designation or assignment. (b) replacement of lenders. if any lender requests compensation under section3.04, or if the borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any lender or any governmental authority for the account of any lender pursuant to section3.01, the borrower may replace such lender in accordance with section11.13. 3.07 survival. all of the loan parties obligations under this article iii shall survive termination of the aggregate revolving commitments, repayment of all other obligations hereunder and resignation of the administrative agent.  70 article iv guaranty 4.01 the guaranty. each of the guarantors hereby jointly and severally guarantees to the administrative agent, each lender, each affiliate of a lender that enters into a swap contract or a treasury management agreement with the borrower or any subsidiary, and each other holder of the obligations as hereinafter provided, as primary obligor and not as surety, the prompt payment of the obligations in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise) strictly in accordance with the terms thereof. the guarantors hereby further agree that if any of the obligations are not paid in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise), the guarantors will, jointly and severally, promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal. notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any other of the loan documents or the other documents relating to the obligations, the obligations of each guarantor under this agreement and the other loan documents shall not exceed an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render such obligations subject to avoidance under applicable debtor relief laws. 4.02 obligations unconditional. the obligations of the guarantors under section4.01 are joint and several, absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of any of the loan documents or other documents relating to the obligations, or any substitution, release, impairment or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the obligations, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor (other than payment in full), it being the intent of this section4.02 that the obligations of the guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances. each guarantor agrees that such guarantor shall have no right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution against the borrower or any other guarantor for amounts paid under this articleiv until such time as the obligations have been paid in full and the commitments have expired or terminated. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not alter or impair the liability of any guarantor hereunder, which shall remain absolute and unconditional as described above: (a) at any time or from time to time, without notice to any guarantor, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of the obligations shall be extended, or such performance or compliance shall be waived;

administrative agent pursuant to section10.06 and (ii)the provisions of section10.10). it is understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any other loan documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the administrative agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. the administrative agent shall also act as the collateral agent under the loan documents, and each of the lenders (in its capacities as a lender, swing line lender (if applicable), potential swap contract provider and potential treasury management agreement provider) and the l/c issuer hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the administrative agent to act as the agent of such lender and the l/c issuer for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all liens on collateral granted by any of the loan parties to secure any of the obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. in this connection, the administrative agent, as collateral agent and any co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact appointed by the administrative agent pursuant to section10.05 for purposes of holding or enforcing any lien on the collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the collateral documents, or for exercising any rights and remedies thereunder at the direction of the administrative agent), shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this article x and articlexi (including section11.04(c), as though such co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact were the collateral agent under the loan documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto. 10.02 rights as a lender. the person serving as the administrative agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a lender as any other lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the administrative agent and the term lender or lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the person serving as the administrative agent hereunder in its individual capacity. such person and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the borrower or any subsidiary or other affiliate thereof as if such person were not the administrative agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the lenders or to provide notice to or consent of the lenders with respect thereto. 10.03

administrative in nature. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the administrative agent: (a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a default has occurred and is continuing;  102 (b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other loan documents that the administrative agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the required lenders (or such other number or percentage of the lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other loan documents), provided that the administrative agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the administrative agent to liability or that is contrary to any loan document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any debtor relief law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a defaulting lender in violation of any debtor relief law; and (c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other loan documents, have any duty or responsibility to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any loan party or any of its affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the person serving as the administrative agent or any of its affiliates in any capacity. neither the administrative agent nor any of its related parties shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by the administrative agent under or in connection with this agreement or any other loan document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (i)with the consent or at the request of the required lenders (or such other number or percentage of the lenders as shall be necessary, or as the administrative agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in sections 11.01 and 9.02) or (ii)in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and non-appealable judgment. any such action or failure to act pursuant to the foregoing shall be binding on all lenders. the administrative agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any default unless and until notice describing such default is given to the administrative agent in writing by a loan party, a lender or the l/c issuer. neither the administrative agent nor any of its related parties shall be responsible for or have any duty or obligation to any lender or participant or any other person to ascertain or inquire into (i)any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this agreement or any other loan document, (ii)the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii)the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any default, (iv)the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this agreement, any other loan document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or the creation, perfection or priority of any lien purported to be created by the collateral documents, (v)the value or the sufficiency of any collateral, or (vi)the satisfaction of any condition set forth in article v or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the administrative agent. 10.04 reliance by administrative agent. the administrative agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall be fully protected in relying and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, communication, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper person. the administrative agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper person,  103 and shall be fully protected in relying and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. in determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a letter of credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a lender or the l/c issuer, the administrative agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such lender or the l/c issuer unless the administrative agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such lender or the l/c issuer prior to the making of such loan or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of such letter of credit. the administrative agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the loan parties), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 10.05 delegation of duties. the administrative agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other loan document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the administrative agent. the administrative agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective related parties. the exculpatory provisions of this article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the related parties of the administrative agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as administrative agent. the administrative agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that the administrative agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents. 10.06 resignation of administrative agent. the administrative agent may at any time, and upon the written request of either the borrower or the required lenders after the administrative agent (or an affiliate thereof) becoming a defaulting lender, shall, give notice of its resignation to the lenders, the l/c issuer and the borrower. upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the required lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the borrower (such consent not to be withheld or delayed unreasonably), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the united states, or an affiliate of any such bank with an office in the united states. if no such successor shall have been so appointed by the required lenders and consented to by the borrower and shall have accepted such appointment within 30days after the retiring administrative agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring administrative agent may (but shall not be obligated to) on behalf of the lenders and the l/c issuer, with the consent of the borrower (such consent not to be withheld or delayed unreasonably), appoint a successor administrative agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that if the administrative agent shall notify the borrower and the lenders that no qualifying person has been consented to by the borrower and accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (a)the retiring administrative agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the

administrative agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor administrative agent is appointed) and (b)except for any indemnity payments or other amounts then owed to the retiring administrative agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the administrative agent shall instead be made by or to each lender and the l/c issuer directly, until such time as the required lenders appoint a successor administrative agent as provided for above in this section. upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as
