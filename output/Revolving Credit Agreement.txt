(b) retroactive adjustment of applicable rate. if, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of the parent guarantor or for any other reason, (i)the ratio of  36 consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda as calculated by the parent guarantor as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii)a proper calculation of the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda would have resulted in different pricing for the applicable period, then (a)if the proper pricing for such period would have been higher, then the borrower shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the administrative agent for the account of the applicable lenders or the applicable issuing banks, as the case may be, promptly on demand by the administrative agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the borrower under the bankruptcy code of the united states, automatically and without further action by the administrative agent, any lender or any issuing bank), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period, and (b)if the proper pricing for such period would have been lower, the amount of any overpayment of interest and fees actually made shall, upon delivery of a certificate from a responsible officer of the borrower to the administrative agent demonstrating the amount of such overpayment, be applied as a credit to all subsequent payments due from any loan party under any loan document to the lenders that were party to this agreement at the time of such overpayment, in accordance with each such lenders ratable share at the time of such overpayment, until the amount of such overpayment is eliminated. this paragraph shall not limit the rights of the administrative agent, any lender or any issuing bank, as the case may be, under section2.05(e), section2.11(c) or section2.12(c) or under article vii hereof. the borrowers obligations under this paragraph shall survive the termination of the aggregate commitments and the repayment of all obligations hereunder. section 2.14 increased costs. (a) increased costs generally. if any change in law shall: (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the adjusted libo rate) or any issuing bank; (ii) impose on any lender or any issuing bank or the london interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than taxes) affecting this agreement or eurodollar loans made by such lender or any letter of credit or participation therein; or (iii) subject any recipient to any taxes (other than (a)indemnified taxes, (b)taxes described in clauses (b)through (d)of the definition of excluded taxes and (c)connection income taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such lender or such other recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the libo rate or of maintaining its obligation to make any such loan, or to increase the cost to such lender, such issuing bank or such other recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any letter of credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any letter of credit) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such lender, such issuing bank or such other recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such lender, such issuing bank or such other recipient, the borrower will pay to such recipient such lender, such issuing bank or such other recipient, as the case may be, additional amount or amounts as will compensate such lender, such issuing bank or such other recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  37 (b) capital requirements. if any lender or any issuing bank determines in good faith that any change in law affecting such lender or such issuing bank or any lending office of such lender or such lenders or such issuing banks holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such lenders or such issuing banks capital or on the capital of such lenders or such issuing banks holding company, if any, as a consequence of this agreement, the commitment of or the loans made by, or participations in letters of credit or swingline loans held by, such lender, or the letters of credit issued by such issuing bank, to a level below that which such lender or such issuing bank or such lenders or such issuing banks holding company could have achieved but for such change in law (taking into consideration such lenders or such issuing banks policies and the policies of such lenders or such issuing banks holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time, the borrower will pay to such lender or such issuing bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such lender or such issuing bank or such lenders or such issuing banks holding company for any such reduction suffered; provided that such lender or such issuing bank is generally seeking, or intends generally to seek, compensation from similarly situated borrowers under similar credit facilities (to the extent such lender or issuing bank has the right under such similar credit facilities to do so) with respect to such change in law regarding capital or liquidity requirements. (c) certificates for reimbursement. a certificate of a lender or an issuing bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such lender or such issuing bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a)or (b)of this section, including a description of the basis for such claim for compensation and a calculation of such amount or amounts, shall be delivered to the borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. the borrower shall pay such lender or such issuing bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof. (d) delay in requests. failure or delay on the part of any lender or any issuing bank to demand compensation pursuant to this section shall not constitute a waiver of such lenders or such issuing banks right to demand such compensation; provided that the borrower shall not be required to compensate a lender or an issuing bank pursuant to this section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 180 days prior to the date that such lender or such issuing bank, as the case may be, notifies the borrower in writing of the change in law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such lenders or such issuing banks intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the change in law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). section 2.15 break funding payments. in the event of (a)the payment of any principal of any eurodollar loan other than on the last day of an interest period applicable thereto (including as a result of an event of default), (b)the conversion of any eurodollar loan other than on the last day of the interest period applicable thereto, (c)the failure (other than as a result of the failure of a lender to fund a loan required to be funded hereunder) to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any eurodollar loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under section2.10(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith), (d)the assignment of any eurodollar loan other than on the last day of the interest period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the borrower pursuant to section2.18 or section2.21(c) or (e)the operation of section2.22 on any incremental commitment effective date, then, in any such event, the borrower shall compensate each lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event in accordance with the terms of this section. in the case of a eurodollar loan, such loss, cost or expense to any lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such lender to be the excess, if any, of (i)the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such loan had such event not occurred, at the adjusted libo rate that would have been applicable to such loan (but not including the applicable rate applicable thereto),  38 for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current interest period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the interest period for such loan), over (ii)the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market. a certificate of any lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this section, including in reasonable detail a description of the basis for such compensation and a calculation of such amount or amounts, shall be delivered to the borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. the borrower shall pay such lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof. section 2.16 taxes. (a) withholding of taxes; gross-up. each payment by or on account of any obligation of any loan party under any loan document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any taxes, unless such deduction or withholding is required by any applicable law. if any withholding agent determines in good faith that it is required under applicable law to deduct or withhold any tax from any such payment by such withholding agent, then such withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant governmental authority in accordance with applicable law, and, if such tax is an indemnified tax, then the sum payable by such loan party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholding applicable to additional sums payable under this section), the applicable recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. (b) payment of other taxes by the borrower and the other loan parties. the borrower and the other loan parties shall timely pay to the relevant governmental authority in accordance with applicable law or, at the option of the administrative agent, timely reimburse it for the payment of, any other taxes. (c) evidence of payments. as soon as practicable after any payment of taxes by any loan party to a governmental authority pursuant to this section2.16, such loan party shall deliver to the administrative agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such governmental authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the administrative agent. (d) indemnification by the loan parties. the loan parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each recipient, within 20 days after demand therefore, for the full amount of any indemnified taxes (including indemnified taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this paragraph) payable or paid by such recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such indemnified taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant governmental authority. a certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the borrower by a lender (with a copy to the administrative agent), or by the administrative agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (e) indemnification by the lenders. each lender shall severally indemnify the administrative agent, within 10 days after demand therefore, for (i)any indemnified taxes attributable to such lender (but only to the extent that any loan party has not already indemnified the administrative agent for such indemnified taxes and without limiting the obligation of the loan parties to do so), (ii)any taxes attributable to such lenders failure to comply with the provisions of section10.04(d) relating  39 to the maintenance of a participant register and (iii)any excluded taxes attributable to such lender, in each case, that are paid or payable by the administrative agent in connection with any loan document and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant governmental authority. a certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any lender by the administrative agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. each lender hereby authorizes the administrative agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such lender under this agreement or any other loan document against any amount then due to the administrative agent under this paragraph. (f) status of lenders. (i) any lender that is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, any applicable withholding tax with respect to any payments under any loan document shall deliver to the borrower and the administrative agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the borrower or the administrative agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the borrower or the administrative agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. in addition, any lender, if reasonably requested by the borrower or the administrative agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the borrower or the administrative agent as will enable the borrower or the administrative agent to determine whether or not such lender is subject to any backup withholding or information reporting requirements. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in section2.16(f)(ii)(a), section2.16(f)(d)(ii)(b) and section2.16(f)(d)(ii)(d) below) shall not be required if in the lenders judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such lender. (ii) without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the borrower is a u.s. person, (a) any lender that is a u.s. person shall deliver to the borrower and the administrative agent on or prior to the date on which such lender becomes a lender under this agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the borrower or the administrative agent), executed originals of irs form w-9 certifying that such lender is exempt from u.s. federal backup withholding tax; (b) any foreign lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the borrower and the administrative agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such foreign lender becomes a lender under this agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the borrower or the administrative agent), whichever of the following is applicable: (1) in the case of a foreign lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the united states is a party (x)with respect to payments of interest under any loan document, executed originals of irs form w-8ben establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, u.s. federal withholding tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y)with respect to any other applicable payments under any loan document, irs form w-8ben establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, u.s. federal  40 withholding tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty; (2) executed originals of irs form w-8eci; (3) in the case of a foreign lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section881(c) of the code, (x)a certificate substantially in the form of exhibit e-1 to the effect that such foreign lender is not a bank within the meaning of section881(c)(3)(a) of the code, a 10 percent shareholder of the borrower within the meaning of section881(c)(3)(b) of the code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in section881(c)(3)(c) of the code (a u.s. tax compliance certificate) and (y)executed originals of irs form w-8ben; or (4) to the extent a foreign lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of irs form w-8imy, accompanied by irs form w-8eci, irs form w-8ben, a u.s. tax compliance certificate substantially in the form of exhibit e-3 or exhibit e-4, irs form w-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the foreign lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such foreign lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such foreign lender may provide a u.s. tax compliance certificate substantially in the form of exhibit e-2 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; (c) any foreign lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the borrower and the administrative agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such foreign lender becomes a lender under this agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the borrower or the administrative agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in u.s. federal withholding tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the borrower or the administrative agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and (d) if a payment made to a lender under any loan document would be subject to u.s. federal withholding tax imposed by fatca if such lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of fatca (including those contained in section1471(b) or 1472(b) of the code, as applicable), such lender shall deliver to the borrower and the administrative agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the borrower or the administrative agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by section1471(b)(3)(c)(i) of the code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the borrower or the administrative agent as may be necessary for the borrower and the administrative agent to comply with their obligations under fatca and to determine that such lender has complied with such lenders obligations under fatca or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. solely for purposes of this paragraph (d), fatca shall include any amendments made to fatca after the date of this agreement.  41 (iii) each lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this section2.16 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the borrower and the administrative agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. (g) treatment of certain refunds. if any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this section2.16 (including by the payment of additional amounts paid pursuant to this section2.16), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this section2.16 with respect to the taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant governmental authority with respect to such refund). such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this section2.16(g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such governmental authority. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, in no event will any indemnified party be required to pay any amount to any indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph the payment of which would place such indemnified party in a less favorable net after-tax position than such indemnified party would have been in if the tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such tax had never been paid. this section2.16(g) shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other person. (h) survival. each partys obligations under this section2.16 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the administrative agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a lender, the termination of the commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other obligations (i) defined terms. for purposes of this section2.16, the term lender includes any issuing bank and the term applicable law includes fatca. section 2.17 payments generally; pro rata treatment; sharing of set-offs. (a) except as provided in section2.05(e), the borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest or fees, or of amounts payable under section2.14, section2.15 or section2.16, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, new york city time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set off or counterclaim. the borrower shall make each reimbursement of lc disbursements required to be made by it prior to the time for such payments set forth in section2.05(e). any amounts received after the time set forth above or in section2.05(e), as applicable, on any date may, in the discretion of the administrative agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding business day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. all such payments shall be made to the administrative agent to such account of administrative agent in the united states as the administrative agent may specify from time to time, except payments to be made directly to an issuing bank or the swingline lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to section2.14, section2.15, section2.16 and section10.03 shall be made directly to the persons entitled thereto. the administrative agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. if any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a business day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding business day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. all payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.  42 (b) if at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the administrative agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed lc disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i)first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii)second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed lc disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed lc disbursements then due to such parties. (c) if any lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its revolving loans or participations in lc disbursements or swingline loans or other obligations hereunder resulting in such lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its revolving loans and participations in lc disbursements and swingline loans and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations greater than its applicable percentage thereof as provided herein, then the lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a)notify the administrative agent of such fact, (b)purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the revolving loans and participations in lc disbursements and swingline loans and such other obligations of the other lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective revolving loans and participations in lc disbursements and swingline loans and other amounts owing them; provided that (i)if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii)the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this agreement (including any payment made by the borrower in connection with any extension of the maturity date in accordance with section2.21 or any commitment increase in accordance with section2.22) or any payment obtained by a lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its loans or participations in lc disbursements or swingline loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the borrower or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). each loan party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each loan party rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such lender were a direct creditor of such loan party in the amount of such participation. (d) unless the administrative agent shall have received notice from the borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the administrative agent for the account of the lenders or an issuing bank hereunder that the borrower will not make such payment, the administrative agent may assume that the borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the lenders or such issuing bank, as the case may be, the amount due. in such event, if the borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the lenders or the applicable issuing bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the administrative agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such lender or issuing bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the administrative agent, at the greater of the federal funds effective rate and a rate determined by the administrative agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. (e) if any lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to section2.04(c), section2.05(d) or (e), section2.06(b), section2.17(d) or section10.03(c), then the administrative agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i)apply any amounts thereafter received by the administrative agent for the account of such lender for the benefit of the administrative agent, the swingline lender or the applicable issuing bank to satisfy such  43 lenders obligations to such person under such section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii)hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such lender under any such section, in the case of each of clauses (i)and (ii)above, in any order as determined by the administrative agent in its discretion. section 2.18 mitigation obligations; replacement of lenders. (a) designation of a different lending office. if any lender requests compensation under section2.14, or if the borrower is required to pay any indemnified taxes or additional amounts to any lender or any governmental authority for the account of any lender pursuant to section2.16, then such lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such lender, such designation or assignment (i)would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to section2.14 or section2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii)would not subject such lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such lender. the borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. (b) replacement of lenders. if (i)any lender requests compensation under section2.14, or if the borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any lender or any governmental authority for the account of any lender pursuant to section2.16 and, in each case, such lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with section2.18(a), (ii)any lender becomes a defaulting lender or (iii)any lender refuses to consent to any proposed amendment, modification, waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof that requires the unanimous approval of all lenders, or the approval of each of the lenders affected thereby (in each case in accordance with section10.02), and the consent of the required lenders shall have been obtained with respect to such amendment, modification, waiver or consent, then the borrower may, at its sole expense and effort (including payment of any applicable processing and recordation fees), upon notice to such lender and the administrative agent, require such lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, or consents required by, section10.04), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to section2.14 or section2.16) and obligations under this agreement and the related loan documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another lender, if a lender accepts such assignment); provided that (a)the borrower shall have (x)paid to the administrative agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in section10.04, and (y)received the prior written consent of the administrative agent with respect to any assignee that is not already a lender hereunder (and if a commitment or lc exposure is being assigned, each issuing bank and the swingline lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed, (b)such lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its loans and participations in lc disbursements and swingline loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other loan documents (including any amounts under section2.15), from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the borrower (in the case of all other amounts), (c)in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under section2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to section2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments, (d)in the case of any such assignment resulting from the failure to provide a consent, the assignee shall have given such consent and, as a result of such assignment and any contemporaneous assignments and consents, the applicable amendment, modification, waiver or consent can be effected and (e)such assignment does not conflict with applicable law. a lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. each party hereto agrees that an assignment and delegation required pursuant to this  44 paragraph may be effected pursuant to an assignment and assumption executed by the borrower, the administrative agent and the assignee and that the lender required to make such assignment and delegation need not be a party thereto (it being understood and agreed that such lender shall not be deemed to make the representations and warranties in such assignment and assumption if such lender has not executed such assignment and assumption). section 2.19 illegality. if any lender determines that any law has made it unlawful, or that any governmental authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any lender or its lending office to make, maintain or fund loans whose interest is determined by reference to the libo rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the libo rate, or any governmental authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, dollars in the london interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such lender to the borrower through the administrative agent, (i)any obligation of such lender to make or continue eurodollar loans or to convert abr loans to eurodollar loans shall be suspended, and (ii)if such notice asserts the illegality of such lender making or maintaining abr loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the libo rate component of the abr loan, the interest rate on which abr loans of such lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the administrative agent without reference to the libo rate component of the abr loan, in each case until such lender notifies the administrative agent and the borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. upon receipt of such notice, (x)the borrower shall, upon demand from such lender (with a copy to the administrative agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all eurodollar loans of such lender to abr loans (the interest rate on which abr loans of such lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the administrative agent without reference to the libo rate component of the abr loan), either on the last day of the interest period therefor, if such lender may lawfully continue to maintain such eurodollar loans to such day, or immediately, if such lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such eurodollar loans and (y)if such notice asserts the illegality of such lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the libo rate, the administrative agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the abr loan applicable to such lender without reference to the libo rate component thereof until the administrative agent is advised in writing by such lender that it is no longer illegal for such lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the libo rate. upon any such prepayment or conversion, the borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. section 2.20 defaulting lenders. notwithstanding any provision of any loan document to the contrary, if any lender becomes a defaulting lender, then the provisions set forth in the following paragraphs (a)through (e)shall apply for so long as such lender is a defaulting lender: (a) commitment fees shall cease to accrue on the unused portion of the commitment of such defaulting lender pursuant to section2.11(b); (b) the commitment and revolving credit exposure of such defaulting lender shall not be included in determining whether all lenders (or each lender) or the required lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder or under any other loan document (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to section10.02); provided that this clause (b)shall not apply to the vote of a defaulting lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification providing for an increase in such defaulting lenders commitment, providing for an extension of such defaulting lenders
