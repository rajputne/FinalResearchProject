(f) notwithstanding anything in this section3.8 or in any of the loan documents to the contrary, in the event that the loans shall have become due and payable, and the commitments shall have been terminated, pursuant to article 8, any amounts received by the administrative agent from the loan parties or their subsidiaries in respect of the borrowers obligations shall be applied in the following order of priority: (i) first, to reimburse the administrative agent for its fees, costs and expenses pursuant to the loan documents;  [credit agreement] 28 (ii) second, to pay unpaid interest accrued on the loans; (iii) third, to pay all other outstanding obligations (whether or not contingent) under, out of, or in connection with any of the loan documents, including the outstanding principal of the loans; (iv) fourth, once all of the obligations (whether or not contingent) have been indefeasibly paid in full, to the borrower. section3.9. requirements of law.

[credit agreement] 29 (b) if any lender shall have determined that the adoption of or any change in any requirement of law regarding capital adequacy or liquidity or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such lender or any company controlling such lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy or liquidity (whether or not having the force of law) from any governmental authority made subsequent to the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such lenders or such companys capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such lender or such company could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such lenders or such companys policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity) by an amount deemed by such lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such lender to the borrower (with a copy to the administrative agent) of a written request therefor, the borrower shall pay to such lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such lender or such company for such reduction. (c) a certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this section submitted by any lender to the borrower (with a copy to the administrative agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. the obligations of the borrower pursuant to this section shall survive the termination of this agreement and the payment of the loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. (d) notwithstanding anything in this section3.9 to the contrary, (i)the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (ii)all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the bank for international settlements, the basel committee on banking supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the united states or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to basel iii shall, in each case, for all purposes of this section3.9, be deemed to have been requirements of law adopted after the date hereof.
