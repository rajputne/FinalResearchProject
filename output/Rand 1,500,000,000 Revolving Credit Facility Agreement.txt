event occurs in relation to a loan for any interest period, then the rate of interest on each lenders share of that loan for the interest period shall be the percentage rate nominal annual compounded

paid in respect of that interest period, to be that which expresses as a percentage rate per annum the cost to that lender of funding its participation in that loan from whatever source it may

period), then for that broken period the base rate shall be determined in accordance with the following formula: r = r1 + (t- t1) x (r2-r1) / (t2-t1) where: r = the base rate to be determined, r1 = the jibar or where it is not possible to determine jibar on any reset date, sar-jibar-reference banks, in either case converted to a nominal annual compounded monthly in arrear rate, for the period closest to but less than that broken period plus, if this would result in r1 being equal to safex overnight deposit rate, 0,01%; r2 = jibar or where it is not possible to determine jibar on any reset date, sar-jibar-reference banks, in either case converted to a nominal annual compounded monthly in arrear rate, for the period closest to but greater than that broken period;  page 48. t1 = the

in the utilisation request for that loan, the interest period for the applicable loan shall be 3 (three) months.  8.2 non-business days if an interest period or a semi-annual period would otherwise end on a day which is not a business day, that interest period or semi-annual period will instead end on the next business day in that calendar month (if there is one) or the preceding business day (if there is not).  page 49. 8.3 consolidation of loans if two or more interest periods relate to loans made to the same borrower and end on the same date, those loans will be consolidated into, and treated as, a single loan on the last day of the interest period.  8.4 day count convention any interest or fee accruing under a finance document will accrue from day to day and is calculated inclusive of the first day but exclusive of the last day of an interest period or semi-annual period, as the case may be, on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and a year of 365 days (irrespective of whether the year is a leap year) or, in any case where the practice in the johannesburg interbank market differs, in accordance with that market practice.  9. repayments each borrower

balance of sums payable by any obligor under the finance documents regardless of any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part.  15.3 reinstatement if any payment by an obligor or any one
