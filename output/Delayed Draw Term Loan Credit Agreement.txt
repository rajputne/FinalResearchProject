to each lender directly, until such time as the requisite lenders appoint a successor administrative agent, as provided for above in this paragraph. upon the acceptance of any appointment as the administrative agent by a successor administrative agent, such successor administrative agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges, and duties of the

(iii)all borrower materials marked public are permitted to be made available through a portion of the platform designated as public investor; and (iv)the administrative agent shall be entitled to treat any borrower materials that are not marked public as being suitable only for posting on a portion of the platform not marked as public investor and shall post the same only on such portion. notwithstanding the foregoing, the following borrower materials shall be marked public, unless the borrower notifies the administrative agent promptly that any such document contains material non-public information: (a)the loan documents and (b)notification of changes in the terms of the loan documents. each public lender agrees to cause at least one individual at or on behalf of such public lender to at all times have selected the private side information or similar designation on the content declaration screen of the platform in order to enable such public lender or its delegate, in accordance with such public lenders compliance procedures and applicable law, including united states federal and state securities laws, to make reference to communications that are not made available through the public side information portion of the platform and that may contain material non-public information with respect to the credit parties or their securities for purposes of united states federal or state securities laws. the platform is provided as is and as available. neither the administrative agent nor any of its related persons warrants the accuracy or completeness of the communications or the adequacy of the platform and each expressly disclaims liability for errors or omissions in the communications. no warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third party rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects is made by the administrative agent or any of its related parties in  76 connection with the communications or the platform. in no event shall the administrative agent or any of its related parties have any liability to any credit party, any lender or any other person for damages of any kind, whether or not based on strict liability and including direct or indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of any credit partys or the administrative agents transmission of communications through the internet, except to the extent the liability of any such person is found in a final ruling by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted primarily from such persons gross negligence or willful misconduct. section10.3 no waiver; remedies. no failure on the part of any lender or administrative agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder or under any note shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. the remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. section10.4 costs and expenses. borrower shall pay (a)all reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by administrative agent, lenders and their affiliates (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for administrative agent and each lender), in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery and administration of this agreement and the other loan documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated) and (b)all out of pocket expenses incurred by administrative agent or any lender (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for administrative agent or any lender) in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights (i)in connection with this agreement and the other loan documents, including its rights under this section10.4, or (ii)in connection with the loans made, including all such out of pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such loans. section10.5 binding effect;

(a) binding. the provisions of this agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that no credit party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder (other than pursuant to a transaction permitted under section6.4(a)) without the prior written consent of each lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by any credit party without such consent shall be null and void) and, to the extent that any obligations are owed to the administrative agent under any of the loan documents, the administrative agent. nothing in this agreement, express or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the other indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this agreement. (b) assignments. (i) any lender may assign (the assignor) to one or more eligible assignees all or any portion of its rights and obligations under this agreement; provided, however, that (a)each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of such lenders rights and obligations assigned under this agreement, (b)the amount of the loans of such lender being assigned pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the assignment and acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall be, if to an entity other than a lender or an approved fund, not less than $1,000,000 (or, if less, the entire remaining amount of the assigning lenders loans) and shall be, if not assigned in full, an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (c)each such assignment shall be to an eligible assignee, (d)the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to administrative agent, for its acknowledgment, recording in the register, an assignment and acceptance, together with the notes subject to such assignment, (e)each eligible assignee (other than, a lender, an approved fund or the eligible assignee of administrative agent) shall pay to administrative agent a $3,500 administrative fee, (f)so long as any warrants are outstanding and unless such assignment is being made to an affiliate of such lender, each such assignment shall be accompanied by an assignment of a portion of the warrants held by such lender equal to the percentage of such lenders rights and obligations under this agreement being assigned pursuant to such assignment and prior to making such assignment, such lender shall have complied in all respects with section3.3 of the warrant issuance agreement, and (g)if the assignment is not being made to an affiliate of the assignor the requirements of paragraph (b)(ii) of this section10.6 shall have been satisfied. upon such execution, delivery, acknowledgement and recording, from and after the effective date specified in each assignment and acceptance, which effective date shall be at least three business days after the execution thereof, (a)the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto for all purposes and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such assignment and acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a lender hereunder and (b)such lender thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such assignment and acceptance, relinquish its rights (other than any rights which survive the termination hereof under section10.9) and be released from its obligations under this agreement (and, in the case of an assignment and acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of such lenders rights and obligations under this agreement, such lender shall cease to be a party hereto).  78 (ii) if any assignor desires to sell any portion of its pro rata share of the loans or commitments (and its pro rata share of the warrants) to any person (other than to a lender or an approved fund) while the obligations or any commitments are outstanding, then such lender shall first deliver a written offer letter (the offer letter) to the borrower and the other lenders and/or holders (collectively, the other lenders) notifying them of its desire to sell a portion of its pro rata share of the loans or commitments (and its pro rata share of the warrants) and indicating the exact amount of loans and warrants (or underlying warrant shares (as defined in the warrant issuance agreement)) desired to be sold by the assignor (collectively, the offered loans). upon receipt of the offer letter, the other lenders (or any of them) shall have three (3)business days to elect to make an offer to collectively purchase all of the offered loans for cash by delivering a written notice of an offer to the assignor (the offer). the offer shall set forth the purchase price (the loans offer price) for all of the offered loans that the other lender(s) making the offer (the offering lenders) desire(s) to purchase, which loans offer price shall, in the event the offering lenders do not propose the same loans offer price, be determined by holders of a majority of the principal amount of the loans then outstanding held by the offering lenders. the assignor will then have ten (10)days from its receipt of the offer to notify the other lenders in writing of its acceptance or rejection of the offer. if no such acceptance or rejection notice is given by the assignor, then the assignor shall be deemed to have rejected the offer. in the event that the assignor accepts the offer, any offering lender and any other lender that desires to purchase a portion of the offered loans, shall have the right to purchase a portion of the offered loans on the terms and conditions set forth in the offer that was accepted by the assignor and shall thereafter be deemed to be an offering lender for all purposes hereunder, and the accepted offer shall be deemed made on a pro rata basis among such offering lenders and other lenders on the basis of their pro rata ownership (together with their affiliates) of the principal amount of the commitments (or if no commitments are outstanding, the principal amount of the loans) prior to such offer. the closing of the purchase of the offered loans by the offering lenders (including and additional other lenders that desire to participate in such offer) shall occur within thirty (30)days after the assignors acceptance of the offer at the offices of the borrower or as otherwise mutually agreed by the assignor and the offering lenders (including and additional other lenders that desire to participate in such offer), with notice to the administrative agent. in the event that more than one other lender elects to be an assignor, then, unless otherwise agreed by such offering lenders, such offer shall be made on a pro rata basis among such offering lenders on the basis of their pro rata ownership (together with their affiliates) of the principal amount of the loans prior to such offer. notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the assignor rejects the offer or the offering lenders, taken together, fail to close such purchase within the time period provided above, then such offered loans may be sold by the assignor to a third party within 120 days after the expiration of the applicable time period set forth above. any such sale of offered loans to a third party shall be for consideration of not less than the loans offer price and upon other terms and conditions, if any, not materially less favorable to the purchaser than those specified in the offer. any offered loans not sold within such 120-day period shall continue to be subject to the requirements of a prior offer and re-sale pursuant to this section10.6(b)(ii).
