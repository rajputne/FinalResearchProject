(e)  funding source. nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any revolving lender to obtain the funds for any loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any revolving lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any loan in any particular place or manner. section 2.12 . sharing of payments by revolving lenders. if any revolving lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of, interest on or fees in respect of any of the loans made by it or revolving commitments held by it, or the participations in l/c obligations held by it resulting in such revolving lenders receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such loans or participations and accrued interest and fees thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the revolving lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the administrative agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the loans and subparticipations in l/c obligations of the other revolving lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the revolving lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest and fees on their respective loans and revolving commitments and other amounts owing them, provided that: (i)  if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and (ii)  the provisions of this section 2.12 shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this credit agreement or (y) any payment obtained by a revolving lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its loans or subparticipations in l/c obligations to any assignee or participant, other than to the borrower or any subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this section 2.12 shall apply). each borrower credit party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any revolving lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such borrower credit party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as 47 if such revolving lender were a direct creditor of such borrower credit party in the amount of such participation. section 2.13 . evidence of debt.

lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, (i)dollars or any alternative currency other than euro in the london interbank market or (ii) euro in the european interbank market, then, in either case, on notice thereof by such revolving lender to the borrower through the administrative agent, any obligation of such revolving lender to make or continue eurocurrency rate loans in the affected currency or currencies or to convert loans that are base rate loans to eurocurrency rate loans shall be suspended until such revolving lender notifies the administrative agent and the borrower in the affected currency or currencies that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. upon receipt of such notice, the borrower shall, upon demand from such revolving lender (with a copy to the administrative agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all such eurocurrency rate loans of such revolving lender in the affected currency or currencies to base rate loans, either on the last day of the interest period therefor, if such revolving lender may lawfully continue to maintain such eurocurrency rate loans to such day, or immediately, if such revolving lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such eurocurrency rate loans. upon any such prepayment or conversion, the borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. section 3.03 .

interest period of such eurocurrency rate loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the eurocurrency rate for any requested interest period with respect to such eurocurrency rate loan or (c) the eurocurrency rate for any requested interest period with respect to such eurocurrency rate loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such revolving lenders of funding such loan, the administrative agent will promptly so notify the borrower and each revolving lender. thereafter, the obligation of the revolving lenders to make or maintain such eurocurrency rate loans shall be suspended until the administrative agent (upon the instruction of the required lenders) revokes such notice. upon receipt of such notice, the borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of such eurocurrency rate loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a borrowing of loans that

(f)the provisions of the foregoing clauses of this section 11.07 are designed to assist the administrative agent, the revolving lenders, the l/c issuers and the credit parties, in complying with their respective contractual obligations and applicable law in circumstances where certain revolving lenders or l/c issuers express a desire not to receive restricting information notwithstanding that certain communications hereunder or under the other credit documents or other information provided to the revolving lenders or the l/c issuers hereunder or thereunder may contain restricting information. neither the administrative agent nor any of its related parties warrants or makes any other statement with respect to the adequacy of such provisions to achieve such purpose nor does the administrative agent or any of its related parties warrant or make any other statement to the effect that any credit partys or any revolving lenders or l/c issuers adherence to such provisions will be sufficient to ensure compliance by such credit party, such revolving lender, or such l/c issuer with its contractual obligations or its duties under applicable law in respect of restricting information and each of the revolving lenders, each l/c issuer and each credit party assumes the risks associated therewith. section 11.08 . right of setoff. if an event of default shall have occurred and be continuing, each revolving lender, each l/c issuer and each of their respective affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such revolving lender, such l/c issuer or any such affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the borrower or any other borrower credit party against any and all of the obligations of such borrower or such borrower credit party now or hereafter existing under this credit agreement or any other credit document to such revolving lender or such l/c issuer, irrespective of whether or not such revolving lender or such l/c issuer shall have made any demand under this credit agreement or any other credit document and although such obligations of such borrower or such borrower credit party may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such revolving lender or such l/c issuer different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness. the rights of each revolving lender, each l/c issuer and their respective affiliates under this section 11.08 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such revolving lender, such l/c issuer or their respective affiliates may have. each revolving lender and each l/c issuer agrees to notify the borrower and the administrative agent promptly after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. section 11.09 . interest rate limitation. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any credit document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the credit documents shall not exceed the 105 maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable law (the  maximum rate ). if the administrative agent or any revolving lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the maximum rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the borrower. in determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the administrative agent or a revolving lender exceeds the maximum rate, such person may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the obligations hereunder. section 11.10 . counterparts; integration; effectiveness. this credit agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. this credit agreement and the other credit documents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. except as provided in section 5.01, this credit agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the administrative agent and when the administrative agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this credit agreement by facsimile shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this credit agreement. section 11.11 . survival of representations and warranties. all representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other credit document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the administrative agent and each revolving lender, regardless of any investigation made by the administrative agent or any revolving lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the administrative agent or any revolving lender may have had notice or knowledge of any default at the time of any credit extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any loan or any other obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any letter of credit shall remain outstanding. section 11.12 . severability. if any provision of this credit agreement or the other credit documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this credit agreement and the other credit documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. the invalidity of a provision in a particular 106 jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. section 11.13 . replacement of lenders; termination of revolving commitments. (a)  if (u) any revolving lender, any participant of such revolving lender or such revolving lender on behalf of any participant of such revolving lender requests compensation under section 3.04, (v) the borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any revolving lender or any governmental authority for the account of any revolving lender or for the account of a participant of such revolving lender pursuant to section 3.01, (w) any revolving lender sells a participation pursuant to section 11.06(d) to a person that is not an eligible assignee, (x) any revolving lender is a defaulting lender, (y) any revolving lender is a declining lender in connection with an extension of the revolving termination date pursuant to section 2.15 in which the extending revolving lenders represent at least a majority of the aggregate revolving committed amount or (z) any other circumstance exists hereunder that gives the borrower the right to replace a revolving lender as a party hereto, then the borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such revolving lender and the administrative agent, require such revolving lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by section 11.06), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this credit agreement and the related credit documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another revolving lender, if a revolving lender accepts such assignment), provided that: (i)  the borrower shall have paid to the administrative agent the assignment fee specified in section 11.06(b); (ii)  such revolving lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its loans and l/c advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other credit documents (including any amounts under section 3.05) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the borrower (in the case of all other amounts); (iii)  in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; (iv)  such assignment does not conflict with applicable laws; (v)  such assignment is recorded in the register; and (vi)  no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing. a revolving lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such revolving lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 107 (b)  if, in connection with any proposed amendment, change, waiver, discharge or termination of any of the provisions of this credit agreement or any other credit document (a  proposed change ) as contemplated by section 11.01, the consent of the required lenders is obtained but the consent of one or more of such other revolving lenders whose consent is required is not obtained (any such revolving lender whose consent is not obtained as described in this clause (b) being referred to as a  non-consenting lender ), then, at the borrowers request, any eligible assignee reasonably acceptable to the administrative agent and each l/c issuer, if any, shall have the right to purchase from such non-consenting lender, and such non-consenting lender agrees that it shall, upon the administrative agents request, sell and assign to such eligible assignee, all of the revolving commitments and loans of such non-consenting lender for an amount equal to the principal balance of all loans held by the non-consenting lender and all accrued and unpaid interest and fees with respect thereto and all other amounts payable to it hereunder through the date of sale and payment by the borrower to the administrative agent of the assignment fee under section 11.06(b); provided , however , that such purchase and sale shall not be effective until (x) the administrative agent shall have received from such eligible assignee an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the administrative agent and the borrower whereby such eligible assignee shall agree to be bound by the terms hereof, (y) such assignment is recorded in the register, and (z) such non-consenting lender shall have received payments of all loans held by it and all accrued and unpaid interest and fees with respect thereto and all other amounts payable to it hereunder (including payment of any break-funding amounts owing under section 3.05) through the date of the sale. each revolving lender agrees that, if it becomes a non-consenting lender, it shall execute and deliver to the administrative agent an assignment and assumption to evidence such sale and purchase and shall deliver to the administrative agent any revolving note (if the assigning revolving lenders loans are evidenced by a revolving note) subject to such assignment and assumption; provided , however , that the failure of any non- consenting lender to execute an assignment and assumption shall not render such sale and purchase (and the corresponding assignment) invalid. section 11.14. governing law;
