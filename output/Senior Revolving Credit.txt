provided that (i)if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii)the provisions of this section4.01(c) shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this agreement or any payment obtained by a lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its loans or participations in lc disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the borrower or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this section4.01(c) shall apply). the borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such lender were a direct creditor of the borrower in the amount of such participation. section 4.02 presumption of payment by the borrower. unless the administrative agent shall have received notice from the borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the administrative agent for the account of the lenders or the issuing bank that the borrower will not make such payment, the administrative agent may assume that the borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the lenders or the issuing bank, as the case may be, the amount due. in such event, if the borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the lenders or the issuing bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the administrative agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such lender or issuing bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the administrative agent, at the greater of the federal funds effective rate and a rate determined by the administrative agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. section 4.03 certain deductions by the administrative agent. if any lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to section2.05(b), section2.08(d), section2.08(e) or section4.02 then the administrative agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the administrative agent for the account of such lender to satisfy such lenders obligations under such sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. section 4.04 disposition of proceeds. the security instruments contain an assignment by the borrower and/or the guarantors unto and in favor of the administrative agent for the benefit of the lenders of all of the borrowers or each guarantors interest in and to production and all proceeds attributable thereto which may be produced from or allocated to the mortgaged property. the security instruments further provide in general for the application of such  40 proceeds to the satisfaction of the secured obligations and other obligations described therein and secured thereby. notwithstanding the assignment contained in such security instruments, until the occurrence of an event of default, (a)the administrative agent and the lenders agree that they will neither notify the purchaser or purchasers of such production nor take any other action to cause such proceeds to be remitted to the administrative agent or the lenders, but the lenders will instead permit such proceeds to be paid to the borrower and its restricted subsidiaries and (b)the lenders hereby authorize the administrative agent to take such actions as may be necessary to cause such proceeds to be paid to the borrower and/or such restricted subsidiaries. section 4.05 payments and deductions to a defaulting lender. (a) if any lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to section2.05(b), section2.08(d), section2.08(e) or section4.02 then the administrative agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the administrative agent for the account of such lender to satisfy such lenders obligations under such sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid in cash. (b) if a defaulting lender as a result of the exercise of a set-off shall have received a payment in respect of its revolving credit exposure which results in its revolving credit exposure being less than its applicable percentage of the aggregate revolving credit exposures, then no payments will be made to such defaulting lender until such time as all amounts due and owing to the lenders have been equalized in accordance with each lenders respective pro rata share of the aggregate revolving credit exposures. further, if at any time prior to the acceleration or maturity of the loans, the administrative agent shall receive any payment in respect of principal of a loan or a reimbursement of an lc disbursement while one or more defaulting lenders shall be party to this agreement, the administrative agent shall apply such payment first to the borrowing(s) for which such defaulting lender(s) shall have failed to fund its pro rata share until such time as such borrowing(s) are paid in full or each lender (including each defaulting lender) is owed its applicable percentage of all loans then outstanding. after acceleration or maturity of the loans, subject to the first sentence of this section4.05(b), all principal will be paid ratably as provided in section10.02(c). (c) notwithstanding any provision of this agreement to the contrary, if any lender becomes a defaulting lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such lender is a defaulting lender: (i) fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the commitment of such defaulting lender pursuant to section3.05. (ii) the commitment, the maximum credit amount, the outstanding principal balance of the loans and participation interests in letters of credit of such defaulting lender shall not be included in determining whether all lenders or the majority lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to section12.02), provided that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of each affected lender and which affects such defaulting lender, shall require the consent of such  41 defaulting lender; and provided further that any redetermination or affirmation of the borrowing base shall occur without participation of a defaulting lender, but the commitments (i.e., the applicable percentage of the borrowing base of a defaulting lender) may not be increased without the consent of such defaulting lender.

hereto that each lender shall conform strictly to usury laws applicable to it. accordingly, if the transactions contemplated hereby would be usurious as to any lender under laws applicable to it (including the laws of the united states of america and the state of texas or any other jurisdiction whose laws may be mandatorily applicable to such lender notwithstanding the other provisions of this agreement), then, in that event, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any of the loan documents or any agreement entered into in connection with or as security for the loans, it is  100 agreed as follows: (i)the aggregate of all consideration which constitutes interest under law applicable to any lender that is contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or received by such lender under any of the loan documents or agreements or otherwise in connection with the loans shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum amount allowed by such applicable law, and any excess shall be canceled automatically and if theretofore paid shall be credited by such lender on the principal amount of the secured obligations (or, to the extent that the principal amount of the secured obligations shall have been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded by such lender to the borrower); and (ii)in the event that the maturity of the loans is accelerated by reason of an election of the holder thereof resulting from any event of default under this agreement or otherwise, or in the event of any required or permitted prepayment, then such consideration that constitutes interest under law applicable to any lender may never include more than the maximum amount allowed by such applicable law, and excess interest, if any, provided for in this agreement or otherwise shall be canceled automatically by such lender as of the date of such acceleration or prepayment and, if theretofore paid, shall be credited by such lender on the principal amount of the secured obligations (or, to the extent that the principal amount of the secured obligations shall have been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded by such lender to the borrower). all sums paid or agreed to be paid to any lender for the use, forbearance or detention of sums due hereunder shall, to the extent permitted by law applicable to such lender, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the stated term of the loans, until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of any loans hereunder does not exceed the maximum amount allowed by such applicable law. if at any time and from time to time (i)the amount of interest payable to any lender on any date shall be computed at the highest lawful rate applicable to such lender pursuant to this section12.12 and (ii)in respect of any subsequent interest computation period the amount of interest otherwise payable to such lender would be less than the amount of interest payable to such lender computed at the highest lawful rate applicable to such lender, then the amount of interest payable to such lender in respect of such subsequent interest computation period shall continue to be computed at the highest lawful rate applicable to such lender until the total amount of interest payable to such lender shall equal the total amount of interest which would have been payable to such lender if the total amount of interest had been computed without giving effect to this section12.12. to the extent that chapter 303 of the texas finance code is relevant for the purpose of determining the highest lawful rate applicable to a lender, such lender elects to determine the applicable rate ceiling under such chapter by the weekly ceiling from time to time in effect. chapter 346 of the texas finance code does not apply to the borrowers obligations hereunder. section 12.13 exculpation provisions. each of the parties hereto specifically agrees that it has a duty to read this agreement and the other loan

responsibility for such liability. each party hereto agrees and covenants that it will not contest the validity or enforceability of any exculpatory provision of this agreement and the other loan documents on the basis that the party had no notice or knowledge of such provision or that the provision is not conspicuous. section 12.14 collateral matters; swap agreements. the benefit of the security instruments and of the provisions of this agreement relating to any collateral securing the secured obligations shall also extend to and be available on a pro rata basis to any person under any swap agreement between the borrower or any restricted subsidiary and such person if either (a)at the time such swap agreement was entered into, such person was a lender or affiliate of a lender hereunder or (b)such swap agreement was in effect on the effective date and such person or its affiliate was a lender on the effective date, in each case, after giving effect to all netting arrangements relating to such swap agreements. except as set forth in section12.02(b)(viii), no person shall have any voting rights under any loan document as a result of the existence of obligations owed to it under any such swap agreements. section 12.15 no third party beneficiaries. this agreement, the other loan documents, and the agreement of the lenders to make loans and the issuing bank to

affiliates (collectively, solely for purposes of this section12.18, the lenders), may have economic interests that conflict with those of the borrower and its subsidiaries and their stockholders and/or their affiliates. the borrower, for itself and on behalf of its subsidiaries, agrees that nothing in this agreement or the loan documents or otherwise will be deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between any lender, on the one hand, and the borrower or its subsidiaries, their stockholders or their affiliates, on the other. the borrower, for itself and on behalf of its subsidiaries, acknowledges and agrees that (i)the transactions contemplated by the loan documents (including the exercise of rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are arms-length commercial transactions between the lenders, on the one hand, and the borrower and its subsidiaries, on the other, and (ii)in connection therewith and with the process leading thereto, (x)no lender has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the borrower or its subsidiaries, their stockholders or their affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (or the exercise of rights or remedies with respect thereto) or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any lender has advised, is currently advising or will advise borrower or its subsidiaries, their stockholders or their affiliates on other matters) or any other obligation to the borrower or any of its subsidiaries except the obligations expressly set forth in the loan documents and (y)each lender is acting solely as principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of the borrower or any of its subsidiaries, their management, stockholders, creditors or any other person. the borrower, for itself and its subsidiaries, acknowledges and agrees that it has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate and that it is responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to such transactions and the process leading thereto. the borrower, for itself and its subsidiaries, agrees that it will not claim that any lender has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to such borrower or subsidiary, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
