become an assignment, transfer and conveyance of any of or all such collateral (provided that such assignment, transfer or conveyance of any collateral consisting of trademarks includes an assignment, transfer or conveyance of the goodwill associated with such trademarks) by the applicable grantor to the collateral agent, or to license or sublicense, whether general, special or otherwise, and whether on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis, any such collateral throughout the world on such terms and conditions and in such manner as the collateral agent shall determine (other than in violation of any then-existing licensing arrangements), (b)with or without legal process and with or without prior notice or demand for performance, to take possession of the collateral without breach of the

law, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the collateral at a public or private sale or at any brokers board or on any securities exchange upon such commercially reasonable terms and conditions as it may deem necessary, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the collateral agent shall deem appropriate. the collateral agent shall be authorized at any such sale (if it deems it necessary to do so) to restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers to persons who will represent and agree that they are purchasing the collateral for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or sale thereof, and upon consummation of any such sale the collateral agent shall have the right to assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the collateral so sold. each such purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from any claim or right on the part of any grantor, and each grantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay and appraisal which such grantor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. the collateral agent shall give each applicable grantor 10 days written notice (which each grantor agrees is reasonable notice within the meaning of section9-611 of the new york ucc or its equivalent in other jurisdictions) of the collateral agents intention to make any sale of collateral. such notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for such sale and, in the case of a sale at a brokers board or on a securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on which the collateral, or portion thereof, will first be offered for sale at such board or exchange. any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the collateral agent may fix and state in the notice (if any) of such sale. at any such sale, the collateral, or portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the collateral agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion) determine. the collateral agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such collateral shall have been given. the collateral agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned. in case any sale of all or any part of the collateral is made on credit or for future delivery, the collateral so sold may be retained by the collateral agent until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but the collateral agent shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such collateral may be sold again upon like notice. at any public (or, to the extent permitted by law, private) sale made pursuant to this agreement, any secured party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by applicable law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of any grantor (all said rights being also hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by applicable law), the collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any claim then due and payable to such secured party from any grantor as a credit against the purchase price, and such secured party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to any grantor therefor. for purposes hereof, a written agreement to purchase the collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof; the collateral agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and no grantor shall be entitled to the return of the collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the collateral agent shall have entered into such an agreement all events of default shall have been remedied and the obligations (other than contingent obligations) paid in full. as an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the collateral agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose this agreement and to sell the collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver.  -23- until the termination date, each grantor irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints the collateral agent (and all officers, employees or agents designated in writing by the collateral agent) as such grantors true and lawful agent (and attorney-in-fact) for the purpose, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, of making, settling and adjusting claims in respect of collateral under policies of insurance, endorsing the name of such grantor on any check, draft, instrument or other item of payment for the proceeds of such policies of insurance and for making all determinations and decisions with respect thereto. upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, in the event that any grantor at any time or times shall fail to obtain or maintain any of the policies of insurance required under the credit agreement or the senior secured note indenture or to pay any premium in whole or part relating thereto, the collateral agent may upon prior written notice to such grantor, without waiving or releasing any obligation or liability of any grantor hereunder or any default or event of default, in its sole discretion, obtain and maintain such policies of insurance and pay such premium and take any other actions with respect thereto as the collateral agent deems necessary. all sums disbursed by the collateral agent in connection with this paragraph, including attorneys fees, court costs, expenses and other charges relating thereto, shall be payable, upon written demand as provided in section9.05 of the credit agreement or any comparable provision of the senior secured note indenture or any other pari passu lien

upon any sale of collateral by the collateral agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the collateral agent or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the collateral so sold and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the collateral agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof. section "},{"sectionNumber":"4.04. grant of license to use

lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and remedies, each grantor hereby grants to the collateral agent (until the termination of this agreement and subject to section7.14) an irrevocable nonexclusive license (exercisable without payment of royalty or other compensation to the grantors), subject in all respects to any licenses to use, license or sublicense any of the collateral consisting of know how, patents, copyrights and trademarks, now owned or hereafter acquired by such grantor, and wherever the same may be located, and including in such license access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer software and programs used for the compilation or printout thereof. the use of such license by the collateral agent may be exercised, at the option of the collateral agent, only upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default; provided, however, that any license or sublicense entered into by the collateral agent with a third party in accordance with this section4.04 shall be binding upon each grantor notwithstanding any subsequent cure of an event of default, except to the extent that such license or sublicense would invalidate or render unenforceable any such grantors intellectual property.  -24- section "},{"sectionNumber":"4.05. securities act, etc.","sectionContent":" in view of the position of the grantors in relation to the pledged collateral, or because of other current or future circumstances, a question may arise under the u.s. securities act of 1933, as now or hereafter in effect, or any similar statute hereafter enacted analogous in purpose or effect (such act and any such similar statute as from time to time in effect being called the federal securities laws) with respect to any disposition of the pledged collateral permitted hereunder. each grantor understands that compliance with the federal securities laws might very strictly limit the course of conduct of the collateral agent if the collateral agent were to attempt to dispose of all or any part of the pledged collateral, and might also limit the extent to which or the manner in which any subsequent transferee of any pledged collateral could dispose of the same. similarly, there may be other legal restrictions or limitations affecting the collateral agent in any attempt to dispose of all or part of the pledged collateral under applicable blue sky or other state securities laws or similar laws analogous in purpose or effect. each grantor recognizes that to the extent such restrictions and limitations apply to any proposed sale of pledged collateral, the collateral agent may, with respect to any sale of such pledged collateral, limit the purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire such pledged collateral for their own account, for investment, and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. each grantor acknowledges and agrees that to the extent such restrictions and limitations apply to any proposed sale of pledged collateral, the collateral agent, in its sole and absolute discretion (a)may proceed to make such a sale whether or not a registration statement for the purpose of registering such pledged collateral or part thereof shall have been filed under the federal securities laws and (b)may approach and negotiate with a limited number of potential purchasers (including a single potential purchaser) to effect such sale. each grantor acknowledges and agrees that any such sale might result in prices and other terms less favorable to the seller than if such sale were a public sale without such restrictions. in the event of any such sale, the collateral agent shall incur no responsibility or liability for selling all or any part of the pledged collateral at a price that the collateral agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, may in good faith deem reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially higher price might have been realized if the sale were deferred until after registration as aforesaid or if more than a limited number of purchasers (or a single purchaser) were approached. the provisions of this section4.05 will apply notwithstanding the existence of a public or private market upon which the quotations or sales prices may exceed substantially the price at which the collateral agent sells. article "},{"sectionNumber":"v indemnity, subrogation and subordination","sectionContent":" section "},{"sectionNumber":"5.01. indemnity and
