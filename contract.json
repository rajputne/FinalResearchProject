All accounting terms used in this Agreement shall be applied on a consolidated basis for any Person, if any, unless otherwise specifically indicated herein. Any accounting terms not specifically defined herein shall have the meanings customarily given them in accordance with GAAP; provided that (a) for purposes of determining compliance with any covenant set forth in Article 6, such terms shall be construed in accordance with GAAP as in effect on the date of this Agreement applied on a basis consistent with the application used in the Audited Financial Statements and (b) if the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent (with respect to which the Administrative Agent shall give the Lenders prompt notice thereof) that the Borrower requests an amendment to any provision (including any definition) hereof to eliminate the effect of any change occurring after the date hereof in GAAP or in the application thereof on the operation of such provision (or if the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the Majority Lenders request an amendment to any provision hereof for such purpose), regardless of whether any such notice is given before or after such change in GAAP or in the application thereof, then the Borrower and the Majority Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to amend such provision (or the definitions used therein) (in each case subject to the approval of the Majority Lenders) to preserve the original intent thereof in light of such changes in GAAP; provided, further that all determinations made pursuant to any applicable Financial Covenant (or any financial definition used therein) shall be determined on the basis of GAAP as applied and in effect immediately before the relevant change in GAAP or the application thereof became effective, until such Financial Covenant (or such financial definition) is amended.

(b) The initial aggregate amount of the Lenders’ Commitment is $45,000,000. (c) The Commitments shall terminate on the Closing Date immediately following the funding hereunder. Section "},{"sectionNumber":"2.02. Procedure for Borrowing","sectionContent":". (a) The Borrowing shall be made after irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. The date of the proposed Borrowing shall be a Business Day. Such irrevocable notice of a Borrowing (a “Notice of Borrowing”) shall be by telephone, confirmed immediately in writing, or facsimile, in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto, specifying therein (i) prior to the Closing Date (x) the requested date of such Borrowing (which date shall be the Closing Date) and (y) the account in which the proceeds of such Borrowing are requested to be deposited with the Borrower 33 and (ii) the Interest Period applicable thereto (with respect to the Borrowing as of the Closing Date and the continuation of a Loan thereafter). Subject to the fulfillment or written waiver of the applicable conditions set forth in Article 4, each Lender shall make available its applicable portion of such Borrowing (determined ratably in accordance with the respective Commitments of the Lenders) in immediately available funds as directed by the Borrower in the Notice of Borrowing. (b) The Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of the non-satisfaction for any reason whatsoever on or before the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing of the applicable conditions for the making of any Loans set forth in Article 4, including, without limitation, any loss (excluding loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund such Loan to be made by such Lender as part of the Borrowing requested under such Notice of Borrowing when such Loan, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date. Section "},{"sectionNumber":"2.03. Fees","sectionContent":". (a) Commitment Fee. On the Closing Date, the Borrower shall pay to Athyrium (or to the Administrative Agent for the account of Athyrium), a commitment fee equal to 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of Athyrium’s Commitment. (b) Agency Fee. The Borrower shall pay each Agent an agency fee in the amount set forth in the Agency Fee Letter dated as of the Closing Date between the Borrower and the Agents, payable in advance on the Closing Date and on each anniversary of the Closing Date until the Loans have been repaid in full. (c) Prepayment Premium. The Prepayment Premium shall be payable hereunder in respect of any repayment (other than on the Maturity Date) or prepayment of the Loans (and any repricing or amendment that effectively refinances any Loans hereunder) including any optional or mandatory prepayment under Section 2.05 or following the acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Article 7. Section "},{"sectionNumber":"2.04. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt","sectionContent":". (a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s Account for the ratable account of the Lenders the outstanding principal amount of the Loans on the Maturity Date. (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender 34 resulting from the Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof. (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be binding on the Borrower, absent manifest error; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (e) The Borrower will execute and deliver to each requesting Lender a promissory note of the Borrower in the amount of any Loans owing to such Lender, substantially in the form of Exhibit A with appropriate insertions as to date and principal amount (a “Note”). The Borrower irrevocably authorizes each Lender to make or cause to be made an appropriate notation on the Schedule attached to such Lender’s Note of the making of Loans or the receipt of payments, but the failure to record, or any error in so recording, any amount of such Loans or payments on such Schedule shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under any Notes delivered to such Lender to make payments of principal of or interest on the Loans or on such Notes when due. Section "},{"sectionNumber":"2.05. Prepayments","sectionContent":". (a) Optional. The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time after the Closing Date to prepay the Loans, in whole or in part, upon at least one Business Day’s prior written notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed by written notice) to the Administrative Agent before 11:00 a.m., New York City time; provided, however, that each partial prepayment shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000. Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of the Loans to be prepaid, shall be irrevocable and shall commit the Borrower to prepay such principal amount of the Loans by the amount stated therein on the date stated therein. (b) Mandatory. The Borrower shall prepay the Loans in accordance with the following: (i) If any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries Disposes of any Property (including any sale or issuance by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries of any of its Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Capital Stock and any sales or issuances of Capital Stock to another Loan Party)) 35 (other than any Disposition of any inventory permitted by Section 6.06(a)) which results in the realization by such Person of Net Cash Proceeds in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate during the term of this Agreement, the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds no later than two Business Days following receipt thereof by such Person (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in clause (iv) below); provided, however, that with respect to such Net Cash Proceeds, at the election of the Borrower (as notified by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds), and so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary may apply such Net Cash Proceeds to reinvest in the purchase of capital assets useful in the business of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary, in each case to be used in the business of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary within 180 days following the date of receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds (or, if within such 180-day period, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary enters into a binding commitment to so reinvest such Net Cash Proceeds, within 360 days following the date of receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds); provided, further, that if within such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) period after the date of receipt by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary of such Net Cash Proceeds, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary has not so used all or a portion of such Net Cash Proceeds otherwise required to be applied as a mandatory repayment pursuant to this Section 2.05(b)(i), the remaining portion of such Net Cash Proceeds shall be applied as a mandatory repayment in accordance with the requirements of this Section 2.05(b)(i) on the last day of such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) period. (ii) Within two Business Days following any Extraordinary Receipt received by or paid to or for the account of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate during the term of this Agreement, and not otherwise included in this Section 2.05(b), the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of all Net Cash Proceeds received therefrom by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in clause (iv) below); provided, however, that with respect to such Extraordinary Receipts, at the election of the Borrower (as notified by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of receipt of such Extraordinary Receipts), and so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary may apply such Extraordinary Receipts to reinvest in the purchase of assets useful in the business of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary, in each case to be used in the business of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary within 180-days following the date of receipt of such Extraordinary 36 Receipts (or, if within such 180-day period, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary enters into a binding commitment to so reinvest such Extraordinary Receipts, within 360 days following the date of receipt of such Extraordinary Receipts); provided, further, that if within such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) period after the date of receipt by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary of such Extraordinary Receipts, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary has not so used all or a portion of such Extraordinary Receipts otherwise required to be applied as a mandatory repayment pursuant to this sentence, the remaining portion of such Extraordinary Receipts shall be applied as a mandatory repayment in accordance with the requirements of this Section 2.05(b)(ii) on the last day of such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) period. (iii) Upon the incurrence or issuance by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness expressly permitted to be incurred or issued pursuant to Section 6.01), the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of all Net Cash Proceeds received therefrom no later than two Business Days following receipt thereof by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in clauses (iv) and (v) below). (iv) Each prepayment of Loans pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.05(b) shall be shared among the Lenders ratably. (c) All prepayments of Loans under this Section 2.05 (and any repricing or amendment that effectively refinances any Loans hereunder), shall be made in an amount equal to the sum of (x) 100% of the principal amount of such Loans being prepaid (or repriced or effectively refinanced) plus (y) all accrued and unpaid interest on the amount of principal of such Loans being prepaid (or repriced or effectively refinanced) to but excluding the date of such prepayment (or repricing or refinancing) plus (z) the applicable Prepayment Premium. No amounts repaid hereunder may be reborrowed. Section "},{"sectionNumber":"2.06. Interest Rates and Payment Dates","sectionContent":". (a) Except as provided in Section 2.06(b), (x) each LIBOR Rate Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from and including the date of such LIBOR Rate Loan to and excluding the date such principal amount shall be paid in full, at a rate per annum which shall, during each Interest Period applicable thereto, be equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period and (y) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from and including the date of such Base Rate Loan to and excluding the date such principal amount shall be paid in full, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate. Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears in cash on each Interest Payment Date. 37 (b) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default under Section 7.01(a) or Section 7.01(g), the Borrower shall pay interest on (i) the unpaid principal amount of each Loan owing to each Lender, payable in arrears on the dates and in the manner referred to in clause (a) above, and on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on such Loan pursuant to clause (a) above; and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by law, the amount of any interest, fee or other amount payable under the Loan Documents that is not paid when due, from the date such amount shall be due until such amount shall be paid in full, payable in arrears on the date such amount shall be paid in full and on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum that would be required to be paid at such time in respect of such amounts. Section "},{"sectionNumber":"2.07. Payments and Computations","sectionContent":". (a) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes, irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off, not later than 2:00 p.m. on the day when due in U.S. Dollars to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s Account, in same day funds, with payments being received by the Administrative Agent after such time being deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08) to the Lenders for the account of their respective Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 9.06(d), from and after the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves. (b) All computations of interest and of fees shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (c) Whenever any payment hereunder or under any Note shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest. 38 (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to any Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due to such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. (e) The Loan Parties’ obligation to pay all amounts due hereunder and under any other Loan Documents shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including: (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, deduction, abatement, suspension, diminution, reduction, defense or other right which any Loan Party may have against any supplier, whether such supplier was paid from the proceeds of Loans or otherwise, for any reason whatsoever arising under or pursuant to any supply agreement or otherwise relating to the purchase of goods, other property or services from or by any such supplier; (ii) any defect in the condition, design, operation, or fitness for use of, or any damage to or loss or destruction of, any equipment or material provided by any such supplier; (iii) any actual or alleged default by any such supplier or any other Person under any supply agreement; or (iv) any other fact or circumstance relating to any supply agreement. Section "},{"sectionNumber":"2.08. Taxes","sectionContent":". (a) Except as required by applicable law, any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any and all present or future taxes, duties, fees, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, withholdings or other charges (including backup withholding) imposed by any Governmental Authority, including any interest, additions to tax or penalties applicable thereto (“Taxes”). If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required by law (as determined in good faith by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender 39 or the Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as may be necessary so that after the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent have made all required deductions or withholding (including deductions or withholding applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.08) such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) the Loan Parties shall make all such deductions or withholding and (iii) the Loan Parties shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (b) In addition, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority any present or future stamp, court or documentary, or similar Taxes that arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, performance under, from the receipt or perfection of a security interest under, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”). (c) The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for and hold them harmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. This indemnification shall be made within 10 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.06(g) relating to the requirement to maintain a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising in connection therewith, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate from the Administrative Agent as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 40 (d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the applicable Loan Party shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt, or such other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender. (e) Status of Lenders. (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (ii) 41 executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and (D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.

Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update 42 such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. Section "},{"sectionNumber":"2.09. Lender’s Obligation to Mitigate","sectionContent":". If the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08 in the future, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. Section "},{"sectionNumber":"2.10. Sharing of Payments, Etc","sectionContent":". If any Lender shall obtain at any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of the Loans owing to it (other than amounts received pursuant to Section 2.08) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Loans obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided that, if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.10 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, in the amount of such participation. Section "},{"sectionNumber":"2.11. Warrants","sectionContent":". (a) In connection with the borrowing of the Loans by the Borrower and as an inducement to the Lenders to make the Loans, the Borrower has agreed to authorize the issuance to the Warrantholders its warrants, initially exercisable to purchase up to an aggregate of 337,500 shares of its Common Stock (subject to adjustment and limitations on exercisability as therein provided), at an initial exercise price of $12.7552 per share to be substantially in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto (all such warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement, or delivered in substitution or exchange for 43 any thereof, being collectively called the “Warrants” and, individually, a “Warrant”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Loans and the Warrants will be immediately separable and separately transferable (subject in the case of Warrants to the applicable restrictions set forth therein and the Organizational Documents of the Borrower), and, subject to the limitations set forth therein, the Warrants shall be immediately exercisable, in each case immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. (b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date the Borrower will issue the Warrants to each of the Warrantholders, in aggregate amounts equal, with respect to each Warrantholders, to the respective amounts set forth on Schedule I hereto opposite such Warrantholder’s name. On the Closing Date, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein, the Borrower will deliver to each Warrantholder a Warrant or Warrants registered in such Warrantholder’s name or Warrants in the name of its nominee, such Warrants to be duly executed and dated the Closing Date, representing the aggregate number of the Warrants to be purchased by such Warrantholder as shown on Schedule I hereto, such Warrants to be in such denominations as such Warrantholder may specify by two (2) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Borrower (or, in the absence of such notice, one Warrant registered in such Warrantholder’s name representing the aggregate number of warrants deliverable to such Warrantholder). (c) Allocation of Purchase Price. It is hereby agreed that, for purposes of Treasury Regulations § 1.1273-2(h), (i) the aggregate “issue price” of the Loans and Warrants on the Closing Date is equal to 99% of the principal amount of the Loans and (ii) the portion of the issue price allocated to the Warrants is 7% and the portion of the issue price allocated to the Loans is 93%. Each of the Borrower and the Warrantholders agrees to use the foregoing issue price and issue price allocation for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (unless otherwise required by a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent jurisdiction) and for all other financial accounting purposes. Section "},{"sectionNumber":"2.12. Illegality","sectionContent":". If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Loans shall be suspended. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such 44 Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBOR Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate. Upon any such prepayment, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted together with the Prepayment Premium. Section "},{"sectionNumber":"2.13. Inability to Determine Rates","sectionContent":". If in connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a continuation thereof, (a) the Administrative Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, or (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Loan (with respect to clause (a)(i) above, “Impacted Loans”), or (b) the Administrative Agent or the affected Lenders determine that for any reason the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the affected Lenders revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a continuation of LIBOR Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in clause (a)(i) of this section, the rate of interest described in clause (b) of the definition of “Base Rate” shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the affected Lenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that 45 any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written notice thereof. Section "},{"sectionNumber":"2.14. Increased Costs to Such Day; Reserves on Loans","sectionContent":". (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall: (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Rate; (ii) subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes); or (iii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (or, in the case of clause (ii) above, any Loan), or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. (b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender 46 such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered. (c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. (d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). Section "},{"sectionNumber":"2.15. Compensation for Losses","sectionContent":". Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of: (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); (b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow or continue any Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or (c) any assignment of a Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 9.13; excluding any loss of anticipated profits and including loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary and reasonable administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing. 47 For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 2.15, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Loan made by it at the LIBOR Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Loan was in fact so funded.

If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required by law (as determined in good faith by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender 39 or the Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as may be necessary so that after the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent have made all required deductions or withholding (including deductions or withholding applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.08) such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) the Loan Parties shall make all such deductions or withholding and (iii) the Loan Parties shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.

Section "},{"sectionNumber":"2.12. Illegality","sectionContent":". If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Loans shall be suspended. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such 44 Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBOR Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate. Upon any such prepayment, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted together with the Prepayment Premium. Section "},{"sectionNumber":"2.13. Inability to Determine Rates","sectionContent":". If in connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a continuation thereof, (a) the Administrative Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, or (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Loan (with respect to clause (a)(i) above, “Impacted Loans”), or (b) the Administrative Agent or the affected Lenders determine that for any reason the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the affected Lenders revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a continuation of LIBOR Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in clause (a)(i) of this section, the rate of interest described in clause (b) of the definition of “Base Rate” shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the affected Lenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that 45 any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written notice thereof. Section "},{"sectionNumber":"2.14. Increased Costs to Such Day; Reserves on Loans","sectionContent":". (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall: (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Rate; (ii) subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes); or (iii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (or, in the case of clause (ii) above, any Loan), or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. (b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender 46 such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered. (c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. (d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). Section "},{"sectionNumber":"2.15. Compensation for Losses","sectionContent":". Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of: (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); (b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow or continue any Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or (c) any assignment of a Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 9.13; excluding any loss of anticipated profits and including loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary and reasonable administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing. 47 For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 2.15, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Loan made by it at the LIBOR Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Loan was in fact so funded. Section "},{"sectionNumber":"2.16. Replacement of Lenders.","sectionContent":" If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, and in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.09, the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 9.13.
